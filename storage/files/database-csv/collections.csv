A number of findings and possible policy options taken from studies conducted the Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) and the follow up reports conducted by the OECD through ACDP support (Education in Indonesia: Rising to the Challenge, OECD/ADB, 2015). Teacher policy has to ensure alignment among these four dimensions and to make modifications in the various Laws and Regulations to address the many performance problems that have been identified in the education sector related to teacher management and development.

Indonesia has around three million teachers. This is a very large supply of teachers compared to the number of students enrolled, and it is growing. Ten years ago there was around one teacher for every 20 students. Today there is around one teacher for every fifteen students. However, around one in ten teachers is absent from schools when they are meant to be teaching. Although the situation has improved since 2003 when one in five teachers was absent, teacher absenteeism remains a problem. Even when teachers are in school, they are often not in class when they should be. The loss of teaching time caused by teacher absenteeism has a negative impact on student learning. Teacher absenteeism is, above all, a problem of poor teacher management. It occurs when teachers work in multiple schools, have poor oversight by principals and are unequally distributed in the system. Improving teacher management is important to improving student learning.</p>

Indonesia memiliki sekitar tiga juta guru. Jumlah ketersediaan guru ini lebih besar dibandingkan dengan jumlah siswa yang terdaftar, dan jumlahnya terus bertambah. Sepuluh tahun yang lalu ada sekitar satu guru untuk setiap 20 siswa. Saat ini ada sekitar satu guru untuk setiap lima belas siswa. Namun, sekitar satu dari sepuluh guru tidak hadir di sekolah ketika mereka harus mengajar. Meskipun situasi telah membaik sejak 2003 dimana hanya satu dari lima guru yang tidak hadir, ketidakhadiran guru tetap merupakan masalah. Bahkan ketika guru di sekolah, mereka sering tidak di kelas meskipun seharusnya berada di kelas. Hilangnya waktu mengajar yang disebabkan oleh fenomena tersebut memiliki dampak negatif pada proses pembelajaran siswa. Ketidakhadiran guru merupakan buah dari masalah pengelolaan guru yang buruk. Hal ini terjadi karena guru banyak yang bekerja di beberapa sekolah, tidak diawasi dengan baik oleh kepala sekolah mereka dan tidak secara merata didistribusikan dalam sistem pendidikan. Meningkatkan Pengelolaan Guru adalah hal yang sangat penting untuk meningkatkan kualitas pembelajaran siswa.</p>","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/Teacher-Preparation-&-Development-(Vid)-pt.jpg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/Teacher-Preparation-&-Development-(Vid)-lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","Teachers; Teacher Supply and Demand; Teacher Recruitment; Teacher Management; Teacher Distribution; Teacher Quality;Video","Guru; Ketersediaan dan Permintaan Guru; Rekrutmen Guru; Manajemen Guru; Distribusi Guru; Mutu Guru; Video","This video graphic depicts Teacher Preparation &amp; Management in Indonesia.

Pluralistic countries like Indonesia affirm the peaceful coexistence of people with different convictions, interests and lifestyles. The Indonesian constitution recognises religious pluralism and diversity and declares that, ""the state guarantees all persons the freedom of worship, each according to his/her own religion or belief"" (Article 29). However, acts of intolerance have been making the news in Indonesia and worldwide, and they have called into question peoples' real commitment to principles of pluralism and ideas of equality in diversity.

The concept of Child-Friendly Schools emerged from work done in the mid-1990s by agencies located in Bangkok, including the UNICEF Regional Bureau for Education and the Save the Children Alliance. Child Friendly Schools came to be defined as schools that operate in the best interests of children, providing the appropriate social, physical and emotional conditions to promote learning and identity formation. The environment of these schools was meant to protect children's rights while leading to the realisation of the child's full potential in and out of school. This has meant promoting inclusiveness, dignity, tolerance, health, nutritional status and well-being as well as community support systems.

This episode of Bidik Jitu discusses about managing diversity and preserving harmony through education. As indicated by various studies, education is the best vehicle to address intolerance and violence within individual capacities that can disrupt harmony. Teaching tolerance is done by intervening children's understanding in the early stages of stereotyping and developing cultural-social values. According to a study supported by ACDP Indonesia commissioned by the Directorate of Islamic Education, formal Islamic education possesses an important role to promote this culture and values of tolerance and peace. The session also elaborates more findings from other studies as well as practices from the field.</p>","","","Mengelola Perbedaan dan Memelihara Kerukunan Melalui Pendidikan","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Bidik Jitu atau Bincang Pendidikan: Kebijakan Dan Mutu adalah program radio talk show dwi-minggu yang diprakarsai oleh Kemitraan untuk Pengembangan Kapasitas dan Analisis Sektor Pendidikan (ACDP) antara 2015-2016 untuk mempertemukan para pemangku kepentingan pendidikan termasuk para ahli, praktisi, dan advokat dan untuk membangun wacana sekitar topik penting tentang pendidikan.

This episode of Bidik Jitu talks about school principals: the management, authority and role in determining school quality. Exemplary school principals are considered an important factor in improving school effectiveness and enhancing education quality. Indonesia's Ministerial Regulation 44/2002 mandated school-based management and placed educational management firmly in the school, making the principal the key decision maker. Principals have been given a role in school finance and budgeting, staff management, school planning and curriculum development. Thus, principals need upgraded skills, training and knowledge in effectively managing schools and resources. Related to this need, principal preparation programs, NUKS, as well as mentoring and continuous professional development are discussed in this Bidik Jitu episode.</p>","","","Kepala Sekolah - Tata Kelola, Otorita dan Peranannya sebagai Penentu Kualitas Sekolah","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Bidik Jitu atau Bincang Pendidikan: Kebijakan Dan Mutu adalah program radio talk show dwi-minggu yang diprakarsai oleh Kemitraan untuk Pengembangan Kapasitas dan Analisis Sektor Pendidikan (ACDP) antara 2015-2016 untuk mempertemukan para pemangku kepentingan pendidikan termasuk para ahli, praktisi, dan advokat dan untuk membangun wacana sekitar topik penting tentang pendidikan.

Kepala sekolah diberi peran dalam keuangan dan penganggaran sekolah, manajemen staf, perencanaan sekolah dan pengembangan kurikulum.

In this episode, Fostering Reading Culture &amp; Improving Library Management is discussed. Learning to read during the early grades has been widely recognised as crucial to the development of more advanced skills. Children who do not develop the proficiency to read in early grades are unable to understand printed information, follow written instruction and communicate in writing, and they are at risk of falling further and further behind as their education progresses. Indonesia has reached the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) target of achieving national teen literacy with rates of those aged 15-24 being high since 1990 and approaching 100% in 2015.

Background	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â system,	 Ã‚Â comprised	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â thousands	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â institutions	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â millions	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
students,	 Ã‚Â  makes	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  substantial	 Ã‚Â  contribution	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â  achieving	 Ã‚Â  universal	 Ã‚Â  basic	 Ã‚Â 
education.	 Ã‚Â  Between	 Ã‚Â  2008/2009-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â2012/2013,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  total	 Ã‚Â  number	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  enrollments	 Ã‚Â  at	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â  pre-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â

students.	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â one	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â few	 Ã‚Â countries	 Ã‚Â where	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â  legally	 Ã‚Â required	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â 
form	 Ã‚Â  part	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  system,	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  intended	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  integrate	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  values	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â 
education	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â social	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â sciences.	 Ã‚Â According	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â scholar,	 Ã‚Â Azyumardi	 Ã‚Â Azra:	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Indonesian	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  product	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  preserver	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Ã¢â‚¬ËœIndonesian	 Ã‚Â  IslamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â

Radicalism	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â Religious	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Islamic	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â expected	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â help	 Ã‚Â prevent	 Ã‚Â  inter-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âfaith	 Ã‚Â  conflicts	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â

education	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â believed	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â  capable	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  cultivating	 Ã‚Â values	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  lead	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â peaceful	 Ã‚Â  coexistence	 Ã‚Â 
between	 Ã‚Â  people	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  different	 Ã‚Â  faiths	 Ã‚Â  among	 Ã‚Â  young	 Ã‚Â  generations	 Ã‚Â  while	 Ã‚Â  simultaneously	 Ã‚Â 
preventing	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â potential	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â conflict.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Although	 Ã‚Â  Islam	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  praised	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  being	 Ã‚Â  moderate	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  tolerant,	 Ã‚Â  there	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â 
evidence	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â intolerant	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â extremist	 Ã‚Â forms	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Islam	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â exist.	 Ã‚Â Extremist	 Ã‚Â tendencies	 Ã‚Â 
are	 Ã‚Â  found	 Ã‚Â  less	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â  institutions	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â general	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â  institutions,	 Ã‚Â both	 Ã‚Â 
private	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  state.	 Ã‚Â  Although	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  current	 Ã‚Â  study	 Ã‚Â  revealed	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  only	 Ã‚Â  30%	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â 
influenced	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  radicalism,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  impact	 Ã‚Â  could	 Ã‚Â  expand,	 Ã‚Â  if	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  anticipated.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â  main	 Ã‚Â  entry	 Ã‚Â 
channels	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  which	 Ã‚Â  radicalism	 Ã‚Â  enters	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  radical	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  community	 Ã‚Â 
organizations,	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â increased	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â activity.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
MoRA	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â especially	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Directorate	 Ã‚Â General	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â (DGIE)	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â mandate	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â 
manage	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â way	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â promotes	 Ã‚Â character	 Ã‚Â building	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â inhibits	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â spread	 Ã‚Â 



of	 Ã‚Â  radical	 Ã‚Â  ideologies	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  efforts	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  managing	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  supervising	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â 
curricula	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â extra-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âcurricular	 Ã‚Â programs	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â pre-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âtertiary	 Ã‚Â level.	 Ã‚Â However,	 Ã‚Â lack	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â resources	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â clarity	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â some	 Ã‚Â legal	 Ã‚Â regulations	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â prevented	 Ã‚Â DGIE	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â fully	 Ã‚Â carrying	 Ã‚Â out	 Ã‚Â this	 Ã‚Â role.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Some	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  findings	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  recent	 Ã‚Â  studies	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  radicalism	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â 
education	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â presented	 Ã‚Â below:	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
1. Radical	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  community	 Ã‚Â  organizations	 Ã‚Â  can	 Ã‚Â  interpret	 Ã‚Â  Islam	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  its	 Ã‚Â  relationship	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â 

daily	 Ã‚Â  life	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â way	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  differs	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  presentation	 Ã‚Â  students	 Ã‚Â  receive	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  school.	 Ã‚Â When	 Ã‚Â 
radical	 Ã‚Â  interpretations	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Islam	 Ã‚Â  offer	 Ã‚Â  simple	 Ã‚Â  explanations	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  complex	 Ã‚Â  issues	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â 
pluralism	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â tolerance,	 Ã‚Â these	 Ã‚Â interpretations	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â attractive.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â Thus,	 Ã‚Â Islam	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â taught	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â 
these	 Ã‚Â organizations	 Ã‚Â could	 Ã‚Â potentially	 Ã‚Â compete	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â religious	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â given	 Ã‚Â 
in	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  It	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  important	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  note	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  community	 Ã‚Â  organizations	 Ã‚Â  offer	 Ã‚Â 
radical	 Ã‚Â  understandings	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Islam.	 Ã‚Â  Many	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  community	 Ã‚Â  organizations	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  moderate	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â many	 Ã‚Â followers	 Ã‚Â including	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â regular	 Ã‚Â schools.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
2. Another	 Ã‚Â  channel	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  radical	 Ã‚Â message	 Ã‚Â  infiltrates	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  indirectly,	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â 

source	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â external	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â school,	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â mass	 Ã‚Â media,	 Ã‚Â especially	 Ã‚Â television,	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â 
well	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  parents	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  family	 Ã‚Â  members,	 Ã‚Â  neighbors,	 Ã‚Â  extra-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âcurricular	 Ã‚Â  student	 Ã‚Â 
organizations	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â extra-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âcurricular	 Ã‚Â activities	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  schools.	 Ã‚Â  Television	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â  radio	 Ã‚Â  tend	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â 
be	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â most	 Ã‚Â popular	 Ã‚Â among	 Ã‚Â these	 Ã‚Â channels.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
3. Community	 Ã‚Â organizations	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â attractive	 Ã‚Â because	 Ã‚Â they	 Ã‚Â offer	 Ã‚Â kinship,	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â young	 Ã‚Â 

students	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â SMP	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â drawn.	 Ã‚Â A	 Ã‚Â collegial	 Ã‚Â kinship	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â  form	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â social	 Ã‚Â contact	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â 
many	 Ã‚Â  youngsters	 Ã‚Â  prefer	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  inspires	 Ã‚Â  them	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  actively	 Ã‚Â  involved	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  various	 Ã‚Â 
organizations,	 Ã‚Â including	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â radical	 Ã‚Â community	 Ã‚Â organizations.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
4. One	 Ã‚Â way	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â mitigating	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  influence	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  radical	 Ã‚Â  views	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â employ	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â wisdom,	 Ã‚Â  if	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â 

wisdom	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  helpful	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  facilitating	 Ã‚Â  tolerance	 Ã‚Â  amongst	 Ã‚Â  pluralistic	 Ã‚Â  communities.	 Ã‚Â  In	 Ã‚Â 
North	 Ã‚Â  Sulawesi,	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  example,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â motto	 Ã‚Â  used	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Torang	 Ã‚Â  Samua	 Ã‚Â  BasudaraÃ¢â‚¬Â	 Ã‚Â  (we	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â 
families).	 Ã‚Â Another	 Ã‚Â example	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â Medan,	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â adopts	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â tolerant	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â  inclusive	 Ã‚Â perspective	 Ã‚Â 
on	 Ã‚Â inter-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âfaith	 Ã‚Â relationships	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â upholding	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â marga	 Ã‚Â (clan).	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
5. The	 Ã‚Â  Center	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  Curriculum	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  Books	 Ã‚Â  (PusKurBuk)	 Ã‚Â  under	 Ã‚Â  MoEC	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  responsible	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 

curriculum	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  textbooks	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia.	 Ã‚Â  Certain	 Ã‚Â MoRA	 Ã‚Â  staff	 Ã‚Â members	 Ã‚Â  were	 Ã‚Â  involved	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â 
developing	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  content	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  subjects	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  writing	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  texts	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  teachersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â 
guides.	 Ã‚Â  However,	 Ã‚Â  involvement	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  MoRA	 Ã‚Â  was	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  result	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â  institutional	 Ã‚Â 
collaboration,	 Ã‚Â but	 Ã‚Â only	 Ã‚Â collaboration	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â personal	 Ã‚Â basis.	 Ã‚Â As	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â result,	 Ã‚Â some	 Ã‚Â dissatisfaction	 Ã‚Â 
has	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â expressed	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â accuracy	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â presentation	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â some	 Ã‚Â religious	 Ã‚Â 
topics	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â textbooks.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
Recommendations:	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
1. Expanding	 Ã‚Â MoRAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â authority	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â supervise	 Ã‚Â unstructured	 Ã‚Â extra-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âcurricular	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â teachings	 Ã‚Â 

and	 Ã‚Â activities	 Ã‚Â conducted	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â school	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â announced	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â promoted	 Ã‚Â within	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â school.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
2. Supporting	 Ã‚Â  MoRA	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  reasserting	 Ã‚Â  its	 Ã‚Â  institutional	 Ã‚Â  mandate	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  produce	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â 

teaching/learning	 Ã‚Â materials	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  general	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  review	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  content	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  non-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â
religion	 Ã‚Â subjects	 Ã‚Â such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â civics.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 



3. Enriching	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â curriculum	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â religious	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â used	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â so	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â content	 Ã‚Â includes	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â values	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â culture	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â peace.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
4. Improving	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  professional	 Ã‚Â  competencies	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  include	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â 

teaching	 Ã‚Â methodology	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â  find	 Ã‚Â attractive	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â  facilitates	 Ã‚Â critical	 Ã‚Â  thinking,	 Ã‚Â 
problem	 Ã‚Â solving	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â approach	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  teaching	 Ã‚Â  Islam	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â places	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  context	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â 
beliefs	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â social	 Ã‚Â developments.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
5. 	 Ã‚Â Ensuring	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  content	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  curriculum	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â  interpretation	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  rukun	 Ã‚Â  iman	 Ã‚Â  (pillars	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â 

faith)	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  rukun	 Ã‚Â  Islam	 Ã‚Â  (Islamic	 Ã‚Â  five	 Ã‚Â  essential	 Ã‚Â  pillars)	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â perspective	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  values	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â culture	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â peace.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â curriculum	 Ã‚Â content	 Ã‚Â should	 Ã‚Â refer	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â lessons	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â drawn	 Ã‚Â 
from	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  global	 Ã‚Â  history	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  history	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  well	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  relevant	 Ã‚Â 
conceptual	 Ã‚Â thinking	 Ã‚Â surrounding	 Ã‚Â international	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â national	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â figures.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
6. Ensuring	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â above	 Ã‚Â initiatives	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â backed	 Ã‚Â up	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â appropriate	 Ã‚Â policy,	 Ã‚Â legislation	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â

FOREWORD

As part of the project activities for ACDP 051: Curriculum 
Reform, the Australian Council for Educational Research 
(ACER) organized a one-day interactive, international 
conference about curriculum reform in Asia. The primary 
objective of the conference was to provide a forum for 
Indonesian educators, curriculum developers and policy 
makers to learn about curriculum reform experiences in 
three regional countries with the goal of building capacity 
for reform and innovation in Indonesia. Educational experts 
were invited from the Philippines, India and South Korea 
to discuss their recent curriculum reform processes and 
strategies. 

Dr Dina Ocampo, Undersecretary for the Office of Curriculum 
and Instruction, the Department of Education, Philippines 
provided an overview of the strategies employed during 
the largest reform process in Filipino history - the transition 
to K-12 Basic Education. Dr Ocampo emphasised the level 
of planning, consultation and preparation the Department 
of Education undertook to transform the education system 

across the diverse archipelago. She highlighted the use 
of mother tongue instruction in the early years to combat 
illiteracy and provide foundational knowledge.

Dr. Anita Rampal, Professor of Education, Delhi University 
provided an overview of curriculum reform processes in 
India, locating them within the global context of Ã¢â‚¬Å“education 
for allÃ¢â‚¬Â and the need to produce a curriculum for the 21st 
Century. Prof. Rampal reflected on the major challenges to 
the Indian education system over the last few decades in 
order to provide high-quality and equitable public education 
to a diverse population and linked these challenges to similar 
issues that have emerged in Indonesia.

Dr. Jung Duk (J.D.) Ohn, Associate Professor at Gyeongin 
National University of Education, South Korea, explored 
the the driving forces behind the need for curriculum 
reform in South Korea, and emphasized the systematic 
and collaborative approach employed by the government 
to update the curriculum to equip students to meet the 
complex technological demands of the 21st century.

INTRODUCTION

 The centerpiece of a nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s educational system is the 
curriculum because it is a highly visible, public document 
that prescribes the goals, standards, learning objectives, and 
instructional practices used in schools every day. Indonesia 
is in the process of revising and implementing a national 
curriculum for primary and secondary grades known as 
Curriculum 2013 or, K13, and the Centre for Curriculum 
and Textbooks (Puskurbuk) is leading the process. In 2016, 
a Rapid Review of K13 led to a series of suggestions for 
revising materials and policies for implementation. In 2017, 
a subsequent collaborative project between Puskurbuk 
and the Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership, 
ACDP, led to deeper analyses of K13, the creation of tools 
for monitoring and evaluation, the design of sample lesson 
plans, and consideration of other national curriculum 
models. A culminating event of this project was a one-
day conference designed as a forum to understand how 
IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s curriculum reforms fit into global and regional 
patterns of change. 

FORCES FOR CHANGE

 There are many driving forces for curriculum changes in 
national reforms including alignment with political and 
cultural values, responses to new technologies, efforts to 
build economic capacity, and pedagogical improvements to 
increase studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ deep learning and enduring motivation. 
Dr. Ohn noted that the driving forces in South Korea included:

 c Need for learners to contribute to a rapidly changing 
society with integrated technology,

 c Change a curriculum that is Ã¢â‚¬Å“an inch deep and a mile 
wideÃ¢â‚¬Â,

 c An emphasis on meaningful learning to build studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 
confidence and joy in learning, and

 c Need to reflect global trends in curriculum design and 
findings from cognitive psychology.

Dr. Ocampo said that the driving forces in the Philippines 
for curriculum reform include social justice, high quality 
education for all students, and providing education to nurture 
a variety of career paths. According to Dr. Anita Rampal, India 
is adapting a national curriculum to advances in technology 
and rapidly changing demands in the workplace. All these 
forces reflect efforts to provide students with opportunities 
to learn to their fullest potential, to grow as well-rounded 
citizens, and to be prepared for work in rapidly changing 
contexts. These same forces have influenced curriculum 
innovations in Indonesia. Indeed, the speakers agreed that 
curriculum in every country is modified and adapted in 
regular cycles to changing demands in local communities, 
and that curriculum is never stable, but always responsive to 
political, economic, and cultural forces. 

CURRICULUM AS SHARED VISION

 Many countries regard curriculum as a fundamental 
expression of national values and educational aspirations as 
well as a stimulus for building studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cultural heritage and 
national identity. Dr. Dina Ocampo shared the Filipino vision 
of education as producing life-long learners armed with the 
ability to reach their fullest potential and cognizant of the 
values that will help them contribute to nation building. 
Dr. J.D. Ohn explained that South Korea aims to develop 
creative, well-rounded learners and to foster a joy of learning. 
Dr. Rampal encouraged the use of Ã¢â‚¬Å“culturally responsive 
pedagogiesÃ¢â‚¬Â to tailor curricula for the contexts and lives of 
diverse students. These goals are consistent with Indonesian 
goals to produce students with the moral character, religious 
faith, and citizenship to contribute to Indonesian society.

Holistic development of children, in addition to academic 
achievement and career preparation, are similar educational 
goals in many Asian nations.

In many Asian countries, new curricula focus on basic 
competencies across the disciplines because they emphasize 
dynamic abilities to solve problems and apply knowledge 
in an adaptive manner. Competencies are regarded as 
more general, transferable, and dynamic than simple 
learning objectives or outcomes. Competencies are used 
to establish standards in many national curricula including 
the Philippines, South Korea, and Indonesia. Another similar 
feature of new curricula is an emphasis on 21st century skills 
such as communication, critical thinking, collaboration, 
and creativity. In many countries, these skills include the 
values and attitudes involved with building character and 
citizenship. In the past 20 years, most nations have included 
21st century skills as part of their vision for students because 
of global educational shifts from (a) acquiring knowledge 
to acquiring thinking strategies and habits of mind, (b) 
static knowledge to dynamic application, and (c) teacher-
centred to student-centred instruction and assessment. The 
vision of highly adaptable learners who have confidence 
and motivation requires a curriculum that affords the 
opportunities to develop core competencies across the 
disciplines. 

SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY

 The aspirational curriculum in many countries, like K13 in 
Indonesia, emphasizes themes of social justice, equity, and 
access across nations of diverse citizens. The Philippines, 
for example, has formulated a vision-mission-core values 

document that states the vision for the Department of 
Education. One feature of this vision is an ambitious goal of 
providing the curriculum in mother tongue languages so 
that young children can transition from K-3 in the language 
they use at home to the primary language used in school. 
The curriculum has already been translated into 19 Mother 
tongue languages, and plans call for additional translations 
into nearly 100 mother tongue languages used throughout 
the Philippines. This allows young children to be taught and 
assessed in their mother tongue languages until grade 3 
when instruction is provided mainly in Filipino and English. 
Diverse languages across Indonesia present a similar set of 
problems, but the new curriculum K13 has not incorporated 
mother tongue languages yet. 

The challenge faced by Indonesia, Philippines and all 
other countries with diverse populations is how to provide 
equitable and fair educational opportunities to all students 
when they have such different languages, family supports, 
economic conditions, and opportunities for learning. 
Many factors might help, including a familiar language of 
instruction. One factor is equal access to schools among 
boys and girls, among rich and poor students, and among 
urban and rural children. Dr. Rampal discussed how this is 
a critical element of educational reform in India, and she 
cautioned against the use of competitive testing that might 
lead to further segregation of children and opportunities 
to learn. Another factor is well-trained teachers who can 
provide contextualization of knowledge so it is meaningful 
and relevant for students. Another factor is access to 
textbooks, materials and resources. Another is improved 
communication between educators and families so families 
can provide appropriate resources and help for their children.

TRANSITIONAL MECHANISMS FOR CURRICULUM 
REFORMS

 Throughout the conference, speakers emphasized the need 
for systematic approaches to curriculum reform, but what 
does systematic mean? We offer some key characteristics as 
guidelines.

 c Systematic reforms include regular cycles of review and 
revision that are supervised by appointed experts. 

 c Systematic reform is guided by a vision and framework 
for change that is shared by all stakeholders. 

 c Changes need to be coordinated and cohesive so 
that changes in pedagogy, assessment, and teachersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 
professional development reinforce each other. 

 c Systematic reform is ongoing and adaptive because 
it monitors performance, gathers data, evaluates 
effectiveness, and modifies programs and policies to 
accomplish the curriculum goals. 

USING DATA EFFECTIVELY

The collection and interpretation of data is part of national 
reforms, and all three speakers discussed the value of 
monitoring curriculum changes and using the data for 
improving practices. Systematic and longitudinal data 
can help track progress. In the Philippines, curriculum 
competencies are coded and used to guide production of 
assessments and textbooks. They created a database of 
materials and the coded databases allow staff to determine 
if all competencies are represented in a balanced manner 
at each grade and if materials are available for every 
competency. The database allows schools and districts to 
re-produce the curriculum and materials if natural disasters 
wipe out schools and books. South Korea uses data to gather 
and share ideas from research literature, stakeholders, 
surveys, and international comparisons of strengths and 
weaknesses that can all inform curriculum change. 

TEAMWORK FOR CHANGE

 The conference presentations revealed that all three 
countries used collaborative teams to design new curricula. 
South Korea used teams of experts from the Ministry and 
universities, and the Philippines used teams across the 
Department of Education. The important features of these 
teams included the following characteristics.

 c Development of a collaborative culture (between 
government and educators) with open and honest 
dialogue for reforming the curriculum.

 c Teams of experts from a variety of areas to advise 
and review the curriculum reform process including 
teachers, principals, teacher training organisations, 
textbook writers, and senior government departments 
involved in assessment and curriculum.

 c Recruitment of educational experts to lead the teams 
through the reform process. This could include the 
secondment of senior experienced educational leaders 
to mentor others and to provide expertise for curriculum 
and assessment departments. 

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS

 Transitions to new curricula must involve teachers and all 
levels of teacher professional development. Dr. Ocampo 
described how Learning Action Cells in the Philippines, 
groups of teachers in a school who provide leadership and 
training for new classroom practices, are crucial resources for 
training teachers. Teacher Networks and Ã¢â‚¬Å“train the trainersÃ¢â‚¬Â 
models are used in many countries to implement new 
curricula, and they require effective teachers with fidelity 
to the principles of new practices. Indonesia implemented 
K13 by training teachers in Grades 4 and 7 first, and then 
trained other teachers in schools, but not all schools used 
this cascading model of training effectively. Additional 
models and resources are needed to train more than one 
million teachers in Indonesia. From schools to districts to 
regions, teacher organizations can promote professional 
development while training teachers in new practices. 
Indeed, pre-service educators at universities need to be part 
of any teacher preparation for new curricula. 

Building the capacity of teachers is promoted by:

 c Teacher Networks that develop a culture of collaboration 
and lifelong learning.

 c Incentives for training, increased wages, professional 
development opportunities, and scholarships for 
leadership programs.

 c Access to teaching resources and online training 
resources, decent classroom facilities, and student-
friendly classrooms.

 c Strong school leadership to support a culture of teacher 
networks and principals who empower and support 
staff. 

 c Pre-service teacher training that is aligned with 
curriculum changes and community needs.

 c Consultation and feedback that values teacher 
professionalism.

Australian Aid, the European Union (EU) and the Asian Development 
Bank (ADB) have established the Education Sector Analytical and 
Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP). ACDP is a facility to promote 
policy dialogue and facilitate institutional and organisational reform to 
underpin policy implementation and to help reduce disparities in education 
performance. The facility is an integral part of the Education Sector Support 
Program (ESSP). EUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s support to the ESSP also includes a sector budget 
support along with a Basic Education Minimum Service Standards capacity 
development program. AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s support is through AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Education 
Partnership with Indonesia. This policy issue has been prepared with grant 
support provided by the Government of Australia and the European Union, 
through ACDP.

COORDINATED ALIGNMENT

 Curriculum changes need to be coordinated among 
various agencies in order to be implemented effectively. For 
example, the speakers discussed how new curricula required 
student-centred assessment practices and the importance 
of national examinations aligned with new curricula. 
Classroom assessments need to become more formative 
than summative and used to support learning and teaching. 
In a similar manner, textbooks and materials should be 
aligned with new curricula. This can be a formidable task 
because of the sheer volume of materials. Dr. Ocampo 
asked with a mix of humor and honesty, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Does anyone ever 
read the entire curriculum?Ã¢â‚¬Â She maintained that someone 
should read all of it to insure that it is balanced and aligned 
with learning materials and assessments. Finally, all speakers 
mentioned how ICT can provide resources and tools to 
facilitate aligning new curricula with textbooks, materials, 
and assessments. These tools can build capacity to create, 
monitor, and manage curriculum reforms. 

CONCLUSIONS

 Developing nations across Asia are reforming national 
curricula in response to demands for more and better 
education to prepare citizens to be well-rounded, productive 
and prosperous. This conference demonstrated the value in 
sharing experiences among countries as they develop and 
implement curriculum innovations. The speakers described 
the problems and solutions, the goals and pathways, and the 
tools and resources they have used in South Korea, India, and 
the Philippines, and the lessons are valuable for Indonesian 
educators and policymakers. A strong curriculum framework 
that supports a shared vision for education allows a team of 
experts to work together to implement changes. Monitoring, 
evaluating, and revising the changes are critical steps to 
continuous improvement. Professional development of 
teachers is essential so they can provide new pedagogies and 
assessments in their classrooms that support autonomous, 
creative, and self-directed learners. The challenges, scope, 
and scale of educational reforms in Indonesia are large, but 
the benefits to millions of students will be enormous.

It is located between Sumbawa Island to the northwest and Timor Barat to the East. All four districts in Sumba are categorized as underdeveloped regions based on their human resource indicators that are lower than the national average. Moreover, based on an index constructed from the national village potential database (PODES), 60% of Sumba's village communities are disadvantaged and 13% can be considered as remote. As a disadvantaged region, Sumba provides a good example of the use of educational research to inform policies, particularly those aiming to improve education quality in disadvantaged schools. Based on ACDP work in rural and remote education initiatives in Papua, the provincial government had invited ACDP to discuss the critical concerns related to education performance in NTT, and ultimately in Sumba.</p>","","","","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Bidik Jitu atau Bincang Pendidikan: Kebijakan Dan Mutu adalah program radio talk show dwi-minggu yang diprakarsai oleh Kemitraan untuk Pengembangan Kapasitas dan Analisis Sektor Pendidikan (ACDP) antara 2015-2016 untuk mempertemukan para pemangku kepentingan pendidikan termasuk para ahli, praktisi, dan advokat dan untuk membangun wacana sekitar topik penting tentang pendidikan.

Pluralistic countries like Indonesia affirm the peaceful coexistence of people with different convictions, interests and lifestyles. However, acts of intolerance have been making the news in Indonesia and worldwide, and they have called into question peoples' real commitment to principles of pluralism and ideas of equality in diversity. In terms of religious intolerance, formal Islamic religious education can play a major role in promoting the culture and values of tolerance and peace, according to a recent research study supported by ACDP. The study claimed that many of the values and principles that promote peace are already embedded in the curriculum, but need better implementation. The study discussed in this session also includes recommendations for better using formal Islamic religious education to preclude violence.

In decentralized education systems like Indonesia's, where local governments, schools and communities are participating more and more in the educational decision-making process, school supervisors are particularly important. There is wide agreement that the system of school supervision in Indonesia needs improvement. Supervisors are used sporadically and their use varies across regions. However, even in areas that do use supervisors, the supervisory role is shown to focus mainly on administrative rather than quality issues.

Historically, most formal education was provided primarily by private faith-based organizations. To this day private Islamic, Protestant, and Catholic schools offer basic and secondary education to a significant proportion of students in some districts. Typically, these schools serve the most disadvantaged students. In mid-January of 2017 the Government made a public statement that will affect DPK teachers. The statement described the Government's intention to reinforce Government Regulation No. 53/2010 strictly. This regulation restricts PNS to serve in government entities exclusively. When applied to teachers, the impact would be to withdraw PNS teachers from private schools and deploy them to government schools instead. The mandate will have a devastating impact on students in private primary and secondary schools and madrasahs, especially those in disadvantaged areas. The dilemma was brought in a debate, as shown in this video, by Dr. James Modouw, M. MT (Special Staff to the Minister of Education and Culture for Central and Regional Relationship); Drs. Syamsul Rizal (Head of Planning of Apparatus Human Resources, Ministry of State Apparatus and Bureaucracy Reform); Drs. Budiantoro, MBA (Head of Center for Functional and Technical Competency Development, Center for Human Resources Development (BPSDM), Ministry of Home Affair); Aloysius Seran (Head of BAPPEDA of West Sumba, East Nusa Tenggara), to build a discourse and create a pressure to the related ministries and government agencies to review and revisit the regulation.</p>","","","Kebijakan Guru Pegawai Negeri Sipil di Sekolah Swasta","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Pemerataan guru yang berkualitas merupakan masalah sistem pendidikan yang kompleks di Indonesia di mana sekolah swasta memainkan peran penting dalam penyelenggaraan pendidikan, terutama di daerah pedesaan terpencil. Secara historis, kebanyakan pendidikan formal diberikan terutama oleh organisasi swasta berbasis keagamaan. Sampai hari ini sekolah-sekolah swasta Islam, Protestan, dan Katolik memberikan pendidikan dasar dan menengah dengan jumlah siswa yang signifikan di beberapa kabupaten. Biasanya, sekolah-sekolah ini melayani siswa tertinggal. Pada pertengahan Januari 2017 Pemerintah membuat pernyataan yang mempengaruhi guru DPK. Pernyataan itu menggambarkan niat Pemerintah untuk menerapkan Peraturan Pemerintah Nomor 53/2010 dengan ketat. Peraturan ini membatasi PNS untuk kerja di lembaga pemerintah secara eksklusif. Bila diterapkan, maka guru PNS dari sekolah swasta harus ditarik dan ditempatkan ke sekolah-sekolah pemerintah sebagai gantinya. Kewajiban akan berdampak buruk pada siswa di sekolah dasar dan menengah swasta dan madrasah, khususnya di daerah tertinggal.

MENGENAI TIMSS 

Trends in International Mathematics 
and Science Study atau TIMSS 
merupakan studi yang diinisiasi oleh 
the International Association for the 
Evaluation of Educational Achievement 
(IEA). IEA adalah organisasi 
internasional independen yang bekerja 
sama dengan institusi penelitian 
nasional dan agensi pemerintahan 
yang telah menyelenggarakan studi 
pencapaian antar negara sejak tahun 
1959. TIMSS dilakukan dalam rangka 
membandingkan prestasi Matematika 
dan IPA siswa kelas 8 dan kelas 4 di 
beberapa negara di dunia. TIMSS 
diselenggarakan secara rutin setiap 4 
tahun sekali dan memungkinkan setiap 
negara melakukan pemantauan tren 
antar siklus survei. 

TIMSS tidak hanya mengukur 
kemampuan literasi sains dan 
matematika siswa saja, namun juga 
dikaitkan dengan sejumlah pertanyaan 

dalam bentuk angket kepada siswa dan 
orang tua murid, seputar latar belakang 
kehidupan sosial ekonomi, sekolah, 
pengalaman belajar dan lingkungan 
belajar. Kepala sekolah dan guru yang 
mengajar siswa yang bersangkutan 
juga memberikan informasi seputar 
bagaimana pembelajaran dikelas, 
sistem kurikulum, serta fasilitas yang 
diberikan sekolah kepada siswa 
didiknya. 

Pada TIMSS 2015, target populasi siswa 
Indonesia adalah siswa kelas 4 untuk 
mengukur capaian Matematika dan IPA 
siswa SD/MI pada studi internasional. 
Indonesia diharapkan memperoleh 
informasi benchmark internasional di 
tingkat SD/MI untuk mengetahui sejauh 
manakah kondisi kemampuan calistung 
awal siswa Indonesia dibandingkan 
dengan siswa di negara lain.

Universalization	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 12	 Ã‚Â years	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â require	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â variety	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â options	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â meet	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â different	 Ã‚Â needs	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
students,	 Ã‚Â  meaning	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  there	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  room	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  expanding	 Ã‚Â  both	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  general	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  vocational	 Ã‚Â  tracks.	 Ã‚Â 
Employers	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â do	 Ã‚Â expect	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â need	 Ã‚Â higher	 Ã‚Â diversified	 Ã‚Â skilled	 Ã‚Â employees	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â respond	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â 
competitive	 Ã‚Â  business	 Ã‚Â  environment	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  increased	 Ã‚Â  export	 Ã‚Â  orientation.	 Ã‚Â  However,	 Ã‚Â  this	 Ã‚Â  does	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â 
necessarily	 Ã‚Â  mean	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  targets	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  increased	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â  enrolment	 Ã‚Â  should	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  higher	 Ã‚Â  than	 Ã‚Â  targets	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â 
increased	 Ã‚Â  SMA	 Ã‚Â  enrolment.	 Ã‚Â  So	 Ã‚Â  far,	 Ã‚Â  there	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  little	 Ã‚Â  evidence	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â  graduates	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  better	 Ã‚Â  labor	 Ã‚Â 
market	 Ã‚Â outcomes	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â graduates,	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â one	 Ã‚Â recommendation	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â both	 Ã‚Â tracks	 Ã‚Â should	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â made	 Ã‚Â 
more	 Ã‚Â relevant	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â labor	 Ã‚Â market	 Ã‚Â while	 Ã‚Â avoiding	 Ã‚Â fixed	 Ã‚Â targets	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â expanding	 Ã‚Â one	 Ã‚Â track	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â greater	 Ã‚Â 
extent	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â other.6	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Some	 Ã‚Â additional	 Ã‚Â issues	 Ã‚Â surrounding	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â expansion	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â listed	 Ã‚Â below.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Challenges	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Graduates	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Opportunity	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â Meet	 Ã‚Â Market	 Ã‚Â Demand	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
1. To	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â considerable	 Ã‚Â extent,	 Ã‚Â this	 Ã‚Â expansion	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â vocational	 Ã‚Â schooling	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬ËœsupplyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â driven	 Ã‚Â rather	 Ã‚Â 

than	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â product	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  preferences	 Ã‚Â  expressed	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â  sector,	 Ã‚Â  notwithstanding	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  innovative	 Ã‚Â 
activities	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â selected	 Ã‚Â SMKs	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â building	 Ã‚Â close	 Ã‚Â links	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â business.7	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

2. Due	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â  lack	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  facilities	 Ã‚Â /	 Ã‚Â equipment,	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â vocational	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â seem	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â  lower	 Ã‚Â 
scores	 Ã‚Â compared	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â public	 Ã‚Â SMKs.	 Ã‚Â Public	 Ã‚Â vocational	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â average	 Ã‚Â math	 Ã‚Â score	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 5.4,	 Ã‚Â 
while	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â  lower	 Ã‚Â mathematics	 Ã‚Â  score	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â average	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 5.1.	 Ã‚Â There	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â 
clear	 Ã‚Â need	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â strengthen	 Ã‚Â student	 Ã‚Â performance	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â vocational	 Ã‚Â schools,	 Ã‚Â especially	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â vocational	 Ã‚Â 
schools.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
3. The	 Ã‚Â  availability	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  jobs	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  big	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  problem	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â  graduates,	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  other	 Ã‚Â  young	 Ã‚Â 

people.	 Ã‚Â There	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â little	 Ã‚Â evidence	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â graduates	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â significantly	 Ã‚Â different	 Ã‚Â labor	 Ã‚Â market	 Ã‚Â 
outcomes	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â graduates	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â SMA.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â Graduates	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â similar	 Ã‚Â unemployment	 Ã‚Â 
rates	 Ã‚Â upon	 Ã‚Â graduation.	 Ã‚Â National	 Ã‚Â data	 Ã‚Â show	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â unemployment	 Ã‚Â was	 Ã‚Â highest	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â young	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
SMK	 Ã‚Â graduates	 Ã‚Â among	 Ã‚Â schooling	 Ã‚Â groups,	 Ã‚Â  reaching	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â disturbing	 Ã‚Â  level	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â nearly	 Ã‚Â 40%	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â 2012.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â 
rates	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â females,	 Ã‚Â however,	 Ã‚Â were	 Ã‚Â lower	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â compared	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â graduates.8	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

4. Demand	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â graduates	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â likely	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â grow	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â quickly	 Ã‚Â over	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â next	 Ã‚Â five	 Ã‚Â years	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â 
graduates.9	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
5. Employer	 Ã‚Â Skills	 Ã‚Â Surveys	 Ã‚Â show	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â significant	 Ã‚Â share	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â senior	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â graduates	 Ã‚Â do	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â meet	 Ã‚Â 

employer	 Ã‚Â  expectations,	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  there	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  no	 Ã‚Â  differences	 Ã‚Â  between	 Ã‚Â  SMA	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â  graduates.	 Ã‚Â 
Employees	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â vocational	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â stream	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â higher	 Ã‚Â percentage	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“very	 Ã‚Â goodÃ¢â‚¬Â	 Ã‚Â scores	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â  lower	 Ã‚Â  percentages	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“poorÃ¢â‚¬Â	 Ã‚Â  scores	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  employers.	 Ã‚Â  However,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  overall	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â 
employees	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â senior	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â issue	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â both	 Ã‚Â streams.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
6. Graduates	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  both	 Ã‚Â  SMA	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â might	 Ã‚Â  suffer	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  different	 Ã‚Â  reasons.	 Ã‚Â While	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â  provides	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â 

quick	 Ã‚Â means	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â training	 Ã‚Â mid-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âlevel	 Ã‚Â skilled	 Ã‚Â workers	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â respond	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â immediate	 Ã‚Â needs	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â labor	 Ã‚Â 
market,	 Ã‚Â it	 Ã‚Â may	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â provide	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â general	 Ã‚Â skills	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â make	 Ã‚Â them	 Ã‚Â employable	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 
future.	 Ã‚Â They	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â may	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â able	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â gain	 Ã‚Â access	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â tertiary	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â even	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â entrance	 Ã‚Â exams	 Ã‚Â 
of	 Ã‚Â polytechnics	 Ã‚Â  tend	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â  focus	 Ã‚Â heavily	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â academic	 Ã‚Â skills	 Ã‚Â and,	 Ã‚Â consequently,	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â  favoured	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â

graduates	 Ã‚Â  rather	 Ã‚Â  than	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â  graduates.	 Ã‚Â  In	 Ã‚Â  turn,	 Ã‚Â  SMA	 Ã‚Â  graduates	 Ã‚Â  who	 Ã‚Â  do	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  enter	 Ã‚Â  tertiary	 Ã‚Â 
education	 Ã‚Â may	 Ã‚Â lack	 Ã‚Â sufficient	 Ã‚Â job-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Ârelevant	 Ã‚Â skills.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
7. When	 Ã‚Â expanding	 Ã‚Â senior	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â education,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â ratio	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â expansion	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â supply	 Ã‚Â 

driven	 Ã‚Â might	 Ã‚Â inefficiently	 Ã‚Â allocate	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â across	 Ã‚Â tracks.	 Ã‚Â For	 Ã‚Â example,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â ability	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â potential	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â continue	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â post-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âsecondary	 Ã‚Â studies	 Ã‚Â might	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â limited	 Ã‚Â if	 Ã‚Â they	 Ã‚Â were	 Ã‚Â streamed	 Ã‚Â into	 Ã‚Â 
SMK.	 Ã‚Â In	 Ã‚Â turn,	 Ã‚Â providing	 Ã‚Â general	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â interested	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â continuing	 Ã‚Â studies	 Ã‚Â might	 Ã‚Â 
be	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â less	 Ã‚Â effective	 Ã‚Â option	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â providing	 Ã‚Â them	 Ã‚Â locally	 Ã‚Â relevant	 Ã‚Â vocational	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
GraduatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â Professional	 Ã‚Â Earnings	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
1. There	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â no	 Ã‚Â significant	 Ã‚Â differences	 Ã‚Â between	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â earnings	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â graduates	 Ã‚Â  fresh	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â 

SMK,	 Ã‚Â although	 Ã‚Â earnings	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â graduates	 Ã‚Â depreciate	 Ã‚Â much	 Ã‚Â faster	 Ã‚Â after	 Ã‚Â 7-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â8	 Ã‚Â years,10	 Ã‚Â eventhough	 Ã‚Â 
they	 Ã‚Â  tended	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â higher	 Ã‚Â  among	 Ã‚Â  female	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â graduates	 Ã‚Â who	 Ã‚Â mostly	 Ã‚Â  studied	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  less	 Ã‚Â  technically	 Ã‚Â 
oriented	 Ã‚Â programs.11	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
SMK	 Ã‚Â Financing	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â Cost	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
1. The	 Ã‚Â  cost	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â providing	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â attending	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â higher	 Ã‚Â  than	 Ã‚Â providing	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â attending	 Ã‚Â SMA.	 Ã‚Â  	 Ã‚Â  Thus,	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â 

proactive	 Ã‚Â  expansion	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â  enrolment,	 Ã‚Â  at	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  greater	 Ã‚Â  ratio	 Ã‚Â  than	 Ã‚Â  SMA	 Ã‚Â  enrolment,	 Ã‚Â  will	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  big	 Ã‚Â 
implications	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â cost	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â expanding	 Ã‚Â senior	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â increased	 Ã‚Â cost	 Ã‚Â might	 Ã‚Â only	 Ã‚Â 
be	 Ã‚Â justified	 Ã‚Â if	 Ã‚Â there	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â clear	 Ã‚Â differences	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â labor	 Ã‚Â market	 Ã‚Â outcomes	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â 
in	 Ã‚Â both	 Ã‚Â tracks.12	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

2. Household	 Ã‚Â expenditure	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â attending	 Ã‚Â both	 Ã‚Â public	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â higher	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â attending	 Ã‚Â SMA.	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â cost	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â attendance	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â highest	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â SMK,	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â households	 Ã‚Â spend	 Ã‚Â around	 Ã‚Â IDR	 Ã‚Â 2.7	 Ã‚Â million	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â 
year.	 Ã‚Â  	 Ã‚Â Students	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â public	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â spend	 Ã‚Â almost	 Ã‚Â half	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â  IDR	 Ã‚Â 1.7	 Ã‚Â million	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â year.	 Ã‚Â Private	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â 
significantly	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â expensive	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â public	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â income	 Ã‚Â quintiles.	 Ã‚Â Expanding	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â 
provision	 Ã‚Â might	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â efficient,	 Ã‚Â if	 Ã‚Â price	 Ã‚Â differences	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â reflection	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â quality.	 Ã‚Â However,	 Ã‚Â if	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â  private	 Ã‚Â  schools,	 Ã‚Â  which	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  catering	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  poor	 Ã‚Â  students,	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  significantly	 Ã‚Â  lower	 Ã‚Â  quality,	 Ã‚Â 
expanding	 Ã‚Â  access	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  private	 Ã‚Â  providers	 Ã‚Â  would	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  problematic	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  absence	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  strong	 Ã‚Â 
quality	 Ã‚Â assurance	 Ã‚Â mechanisms	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â these	 Ã‚Â schools.13	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
3. Public	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â better	 Ã‚Â facilities	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â privat	 Ã‚Â SMKs	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â types	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â facilities.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Availability	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â Teachers	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â

3. There	 Ã‚Â seems	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â shortage	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â teachers,	 Ã‚Â especially	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â SMK,	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â student	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â

average,	 Ã‚Â  public	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  60-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â80	 Ã‚Â  teachers,	 Ã‚Â  while	 Ã‚Â  private	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  much	 Ã‚Â  smaller	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â

The	 Ã‚Â  Ministry	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Education	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  Culture	 Ã‚Â  (MoEC)	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  taken	 Ã‚Â  innovation	 Ã‚Â  seriously	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  part	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â

sizable	 Ã‚Â  government	 Ã‚Â  investments	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  reforms	 Ã‚Â  accompanied	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â  decentralization,	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  some	 Ã‚Â 
flexibility	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  program	 Ã‚Â  content	 Ã‚Â  across	 Ã‚Â  regions,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  ability	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  plan,	 Ã‚Â  budget	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  finance	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  regional	 Ã‚Â

Policy	 Ã‚Â options	 Ã‚Â 
1. Ensure	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  there	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  opportunities	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â  students,	 Ã‚Â  especially	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  poorest	 Ã‚Â 

households,	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â pursue	 Ã‚Â further	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â Create	 Ã‚Â flexible	 Ã‚Â pathways	 Ã‚Â so	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â streamed	 Ã‚Â 
into	 Ã‚Â vocational	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â gain	 Ã‚Â entry	 Ã‚Â  into	 Ã‚Â tertiary	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â This	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â  include	 Ã‚Â addressing	 Ã‚Â 
issues	 Ã‚Â  related	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  entrance	 Ã‚Â  exam	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  assessment	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  tertiary	 Ã‚Â  education,	 Ã‚Â  which	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â 
currently	 Ã‚Â placing	 Ã‚Â SMK	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â disadvantage	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â gaining	 Ã‚Â entry	 Ã‚Â into	 Ã‚Â tertiary	 Ã‚Â education.18	 Ã‚Â 

2. Create	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â demand	 Ã‚Â driven	 Ã‚Â mix	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â SMA/SMK	 Ã‚Â using	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â  functioning	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â assurance	 Ã‚Â  system	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â

from	 Ã‚Â both	 Ã‚Â tracks	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â labor	 Ã‚Â market	 Ã‚Â suggests	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â neither	 Ã‚Â track	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â significantly	 Ã‚Â better	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 
other	 Ã‚Â without	 Ã‚Â further	 Ã‚Â study.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

3. Ensure	 Ã‚Â  permeability	 Ã‚Â  between	 Ã‚Â  SMA	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  SMK	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  provide	 Ã‚Â  opportunities	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  vocational	 Ã‚Â 
graduates	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â continually	 Ã‚Â acquire	 Ã‚Â relevant	 Ã‚Â skills.	 Ã‚Â 

4. Explore	 Ã‚Â  different	 Ã‚Â  methods	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  providing	 Ã‚Â  vocational	 Ã‚Â  education,	 Ã‚Â  including	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  mix	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â 
academic	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â vocational	 Ã‚Â  training.	 Ã‚Â Provide	 Ã‚Â vocational	 Ã‚Â  training	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â both	 Ã‚Â tracks	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â  In	 Ã‚Â 
addition,	 Ã‚Â balance	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â senior	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â curriculum	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â both	 Ã‚Â tracks	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â ensure	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â strong	 Ã‚Â base	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
cognitive	 Ã‚Â skills	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â improving	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â increasing	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â general	 Ã‚Â curriculum	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â SMK,	 Ã‚Â 
especially	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â early	 Ã‚Â years.	 Ã‚Â 

5. Prioritize	 Ã‚Â practical	 Ã‚Â experience	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â internships	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â programs	 Ã‚Â over	 Ã‚Â technical	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â 
in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â classroom	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â SMK.	 Ã‚Â

The	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â system	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â similarities	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â systems	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â countries	 Ã‚Â 
where	 Ã‚Â Muslims	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â majority	 Ã‚Â  population	 Ã‚Â  (such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  Egypt,	 Ã‚Â Nigeria,	 Ã‚Â  Pakistan,	 Ã‚Â  Turkey,	 Ã‚Â  Bangladesh,	 Ã‚Â 
Afghanistan,	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  Syria).	 Ã‚Â  Nonetheless,	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia,	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  legally	 Ã‚Â  recognized	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â 
integral	 Ã‚Â part	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â national	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â system.	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â considered	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â equal	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 
regular	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â provided	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â state	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â educational	 Ã‚Â institutions.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Thus,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â success	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â 12-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyear	 Ã‚Â compulsory	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â program	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â only	 Ã‚Â determined	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â Ministry	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Education	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  Culture	 Ã‚Â  but	 Ã‚Â  also	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â Ministry	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Religious	 Ã‚Â  Affairs.	 Ã‚Â  This	 Ã‚Â  year,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
Central	 Ã‚Â  Government,	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Ministry	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Religious	 Ã‚Â  Affairs,	 Ã‚Â  provided	 Ã‚Â  1.7	 Ã‚Â  trillion	 Ã‚Â  Rupiah	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â 
improve	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â sub-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âsector	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Indonesia.	 Ã‚Â This	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â focused	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â developing	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
strengthening	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  12-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyear	 Ã‚Â  compulsory	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  program,	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  initiatives	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
construction	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â classrooms,	 Ã‚Â laboratories	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â infrastructure	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â well	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â capacity	 Ã‚Â building	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â 
teachers.	 Ã‚Â

The	 Ã‚Â  Strategic	 Ã‚Â  Plan	 Ã‚Â  2015-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â2019	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Ministry	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Religious	 Ã‚Â  Affairs	 Ã‚Â  outlines	 Ã‚Â  efforts	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  achieve	 Ã‚Â 
development	 Ã‚Â  priorities	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  areas	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  religion	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  within	 Ã‚Â  five	 Ã‚Â  years.	 Ã‚Â  These	 Ã‚Â  priorities	 Ã‚Â 
include	 Ã‚Â  improving	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  equitable	 Ã‚Â  access	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  religious-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Ârelated	 Ã‚Â 
education.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Readiness	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â (Regular	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â Features	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â Religious	 Ã‚Â 
Education)	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Implementation	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 12-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyear	 Ã‚Â Compulsory	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â Law	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Local	 Ã‚Â Government,	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â was	 Ã‚Â first	 Ã‚Â  issued	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â 2003,	 Ã‚Â (then	 Ã‚Â revised	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â 2009),	 Ã‚Â gave	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 
Ministry	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Home	 Ã‚Â Affairs	 Ã‚Â  (MoHA)	 Ã‚Â  responsibility	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  implementation	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  rules	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â  regulations	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
regional	 Ã‚Â  autonomy.	 Ã‚Â  Local	 Ã‚Â  governments	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  primary	 Ã‚Â  responsibility	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  public	 Ã‚Â  services	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
various	 Ã‚Â economic	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â social	 Ã‚Â sectors,	 Ã‚Â including	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â Thus,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â Service	 Ã‚Â Offices	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 
provinces	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â districts/cities	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â now	 Ã‚Â responsible	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â governor	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â regent/mayor	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â provision	 Ã‚Â 
of	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â services,	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Ministry	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Culture.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
However,	 Ã‚Â  activities	 Ã‚Â  related	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  affairs	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  decentralized	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  remain	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  full	 Ã‚Â 
responsibility	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Ministry	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Religious	 Ã‚Â  Affairs.	 Ã‚Â  Therefore,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  provincial	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  district/city	 Ã‚Â 
governments	 Ã‚Â do	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â their	 Ã‚Â own	 Ã‚Â religious	 Ã‚Â affairs	 Ã‚Â offices.	 Ã‚Â Instead,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Ministry	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Religious	 Ã‚Â Affairs	 Ã‚Â 
has	 Ã‚Â representative	 Ã‚Â offices	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â provinces	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â districts/cities.	 Ã‚Â

Law	 Ã‚Â No.	 Ã‚Â 20/2003	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â National	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â System,	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â emphasizes	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â right	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â 
Indonesian	 Ã‚Â  citizens,	 Ã‚Â  also	 Ã‚Â  covers	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  education,	 Ã‚Â  including	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â 
provided	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â pesantren.	 Ã‚Â Under	 Ã‚Â this	 Ã‚Â law,	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â religious	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â institutions	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â considered	 Ã‚Â part	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â national	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â system	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Indonesia.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â who	 Ã‚Â attend	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â religious	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â primary	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â levels	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â 
reached	 Ã‚Â approximately	 Ã‚Â 4,45	 Ã‚Â million	 Ã‚Â children.	 Ã‚Â Most	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â these	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â (4,14	 Ã‚Â million)	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â still	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Ula	 Ã‚Â 
level	 Ã‚Â (the	 Ã‚Â equivalent	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â elementary	 Ã‚Â school).	 Ã‚Â It	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â important	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â ensure	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â these	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â continue	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â 
pursue	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  next	 Ã‚Â  level	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  education,	 Ã‚Â  which	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  equivalent	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  secondary	 Ã‚Â  education,	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  then	 Ã‚Â 
continue	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â complete	 Ã‚Â 12-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyear	 Ã‚Â compulsory	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Accordingly,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Ministry	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Religious	 Ã‚Â  Affairs	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  reformed	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  institutions	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â 
programs	 Ã‚Â using	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â model	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  formal	 Ã‚Â Diniyah	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Muadalah	 Ã‚Â programs	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â primary	 Ã‚Â  level	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â higher	 Ã‚Â 
education.	 Ã‚Â Such	 Ã‚Â reform	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â made	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Regulation	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Minister	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Religious	 Ã‚Â Affairs	 Ã‚Â No.	 Ã‚Â 13	 Ã‚Â 
&	 Ã‚Â 18	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 2014.	 Ã‚Â

Challenges:	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â Management	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  Information	 Ã‚Â  System	 Ã‚Â  (EMIS)	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â Ministry	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Religious	 Ã‚Â Affairs	 Ã‚Â 
continues	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  centralized,	 Ã‚Â  so	 Ã‚Â  neither	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  district/city	 Ã‚Â  offices	 Ã‚Â  nor	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  provincial	 Ã‚Â  offices	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
Ministry	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Religious	 Ã‚Â  Affairs	 Ã‚Â  can	 Ã‚Â  easily	 Ã‚Â  access	 Ã‚Â  data	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  their	 Ã‚Â  respective	 Ã‚Â 
jurisdictions.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â  EMIS	 Ã‚Â  system	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  included	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  data,	 Ã‚Â  but	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  yet	 Ã‚Â  included	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
components	 Ã‚Â needed	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â developing	 Ã‚Â religious	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Weaknesses	 Ã‚Â related	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â data	 Ã‚Â access	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â lack	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â mechanisms	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â close	 Ã‚Â coordination	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â planning	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â budgeting	 Ã‚Â between	 Ã‚Â Local	 Ã‚Â Governments	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Office	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Religious	 Ã‚Â Affairs	 Ã‚Â led	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â low	 Ã‚Â capacity	 Ã‚Â 
at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â local	 Ã‚Â government	 Ã‚Â level	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â providing	 Ã‚Â funds	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â forms	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â support	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Some	 Ã‚Â  legislations	 Ã‚Â  related	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â  governments	 Ã‚Â  restrict	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  provincial	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  district/city	 Ã‚Â 
governments	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â funding	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â education,	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â institutionally	 Ã‚Â still	 Ã‚Â centralized.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Efforts	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  develop	 Ã‚Â  programs,	 Ã‚Â  standards	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  facilities	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  support	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â 
require	 Ã‚Â substantial	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â support,	 Ã‚Â whereas	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â available	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â still	 Ã‚Â very	 Ã‚Â limited.	 Ã‚Â

Recommendations	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

Recommendations	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  address	 Ã‚Â  some	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  issues	 Ã‚Â  encountered	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  managing	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â 
education	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â local	 Ã‚Â level	 Ã‚Â due	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â laws	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â decentralization	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â follow:	 Ã‚Â 
o MoRA	 Ã‚Â  could	 Ã‚Â  prepare	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  issue	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  Joint	 Ã‚Â  Ministerial	 Ã‚Â  Decree	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â Ministry	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Home	 Ã‚Â  Affairs,	 Ã‚Â 

which	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  central	 Ã‚Â  authority	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  oversee	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â  governments.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â  joint	 Ã‚Â  ministerial	 Ã‚Â 
regulation	 Ã‚Â  should	 Ã‚Â  require	 Ã‚Â  (not	 Ã‚Â  only	 Ã‚Â  allow)	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Provincial	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  District/City	 Ã‚Â  Education	 Ã‚Â  Service	 Ã‚Â 
Offices	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â Regional	 Ã‚Â Development	 Ã‚Â  Planning	 Ã‚Â Board	 Ã‚Â  (Bappeda)	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  involve	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  local/regional	 Ã‚Â 
MoRA	 Ã‚Â  Offices	 Ã‚Â  (Kandep/Kanwil)	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  program	 Ã‚Â  planning	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  budgeting	 Ã‚Â  used	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  finance	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
madrasah	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â pesantren	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â providing	 Ã‚Â basic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â services	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â mandated	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â legislation.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
Recommendations	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â address	 Ã‚Â  issues	 Ã‚Â related	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â funding,	 Ã‚Â expanded	 Ã‚Â access	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â improved	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
Islamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â below:	 Ã‚Â 

o The	 Ã‚Â policy	 Ã‚Â makers	 Ã‚Â  at	 Ã‚Â MoRA	 Ã‚Â might	 Ã‚Â  consider	 Ã‚Â  using	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â  effective	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â efficient	 Ã‚Â 
manner,	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  various	 Ã‚Â  strategic	 Ã‚Â  options	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  expand	 Ã‚Â  access	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  education.	 Ã‚Â  For	 Ã‚Â  example,	 Ã‚Â  open	 Ã‚Â 
schools,	 Ã‚Â  small	 Ã‚Â  schools,	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  one-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âroof	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  could	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  used	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  alternatives	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  building	 Ã‚Â  more	 Ã‚Â 
public	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â madrasah.	 Ã‚Â 



	 Ã‚Â  3	 Ã‚Â 

o Implement	 Ã‚Â self-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âreturns	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â requiring	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â counterpart	 Ã‚Â fund	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â stimulus	 Ã‚Â funding	 Ã‚Â approaches	 Ã‚Â 
as	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â means	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â DG	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â participatory	 Ã‚Â control	 Ã‚Â over	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â 
provided	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â government,	 Ã‚Â such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â salaries	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â allowances	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â teachers.	 Ã‚Â 

o Raise	 Ã‚Â  more	 Ã‚Â  funding	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  provincial	 Ã‚Â  governments,	 Ã‚Â  potentially	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  provincial	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  district/city	 Ã‚Â 
budgets,	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  Madrasah.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â  allocation	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  government	 Ã‚Â  budget	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  goes	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  support	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
development	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  needs	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  increased.	 Ã‚Â  As	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â majority	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â 
religious	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â organized	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â institutions,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â funds	 Ã‚Â should	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â disbursed	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â form	 Ã‚Â 
of	 Ã‚Â  bantuan	 Ã‚Â  imbal	 Ã‚Â  swadaya	 Ã‚Â  (self-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âreturns	 Ã‚Â  grant	 Ã‚Â  assistance)	 Ã‚Â  followed	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  dana	 Ã‚Â  pendamping	 Ã‚Â 
(counterpart	 Ã‚Â funds).	 Ã‚Â 

o Negotiate	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â  MoEC	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  ensure	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  regulations	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  technical	 Ã‚Â  guidelines	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  managing	 Ã‚Â 
infrastructure	 Ã‚Â  funds	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  transferred	 Ã‚Â  directly	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  DAK	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  MoEC	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â 
government	 Ã‚Â budget.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â obligations	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â local	 Ã‚Â governments	 Ã‚Â should	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â specified	 Ã‚Â so	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â 
education	 Ã‚Â (madrasah)	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â included	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â one	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â recipients.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â  ACDP	 Ã‚Â  study	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  Madrasah	 Ã‚Â  Education	 Ã‚Â  Financing,	 Ã‚Â  conducted	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  2012,	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  sample	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  120	 Ã‚Â 
madrasahs	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  5	 Ã‚Â  provinces:	 Ã‚Â  (West	 Ã‚Â  Sumatra,	 Ã‚Â  East	 Ã‚Â  Java,	 Ã‚Â  East	 Ã‚Â  Kalimantan,	 Ã‚Â  Gorontalo,	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â West	 Ã‚Â  Nusa	 Ã‚Â

in	 Ã‚Â  proportion	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  level	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  schooling.	 Ã‚Â  This	 Ã‚Â  trend	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  reasonable	 Ã‚Â  considering	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  cost	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â

By	 Ã‚Â 2012/2013,	 Ã‚Â  there	 Ã‚Â were	 Ã‚Â 73.786	 Ã‚Â RA/BA	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia.	 Ã‚Â RA/BA	 Ã‚Â (Islamic	 Ã‚Â kindergarten)	 Ã‚Â 
has	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â largest	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â student	 Ã‚Â enrollments,	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â growing	 Ã‚Â rapidly	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â recent	 Ã‚Â 
years.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â significantly	 Ã‚Â higher	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â public	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â (96%:4%).	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
In	 Ã‚Â  2012/2013,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  majority	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  RA/BA	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  madrasah	 Ã‚Â  were	 Ã‚Â  located	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Java	 Ã‚Â  (East	 Ã‚Â  Java,	 Ã‚Â  West	 Ã‚Â  Java,	 Ã‚Â

When	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 9-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyear	 Ã‚Â compulsory	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â was	 Ã‚Â launched	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â 2014,	 Ã‚Â SMP	 Ã‚Â received	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â focus	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â efforts	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â 
improve	 Ã‚Â  access	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  basic	 Ã‚Â  education.	 Ã‚Â  Now,	 Ã‚Â  given	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  implementation	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  12-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyear	 Ã‚Â 
compulsory	 Ã‚Â education,	 Ã‚Â it	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â expected	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Ministry	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Religious	 Ã‚Â Affairs	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â focus	 Ã‚Â its	 Ã‚Â resources	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â MA	 Ã‚Â level.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
In	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â  cases,	 Ã‚Â  public	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  public	 Ã‚Â  madrasah	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  proven	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  better	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  than	 Ã‚Â  private	 Ã‚Â 
schools	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â madrasah.	 Ã‚Â However,	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â contribute	 Ã‚Â greatly	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â  national	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  system.	 Ã‚Â  Therefore,	 Ã‚Â  policy	 Ã‚Â  should	 Ã‚Â  better	 Ã‚Â  enable	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  provision	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  resources	 Ã‚Â 
from	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â central	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â regional	 Ã‚Â governments	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â improve	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â institutions	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â programs,	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â further	 Ã‚Â increase	 Ã‚Â public	 Ã‚Â support	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â them.	 Ã‚Â

	 Ã‚Â 
1. National	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â Standards	 Ã‚Â (SNP)	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

The	 Ã‚Â National	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â Standards	 Ã‚Â (SNP)	 Ã‚Â determine	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â basic	 Ã‚Â threshold	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â achieving	 Ã‚Â accreditation	 Ã‚Â 
for	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  madrasah.	 Ã‚Â  Only	 Ã‚Â  accredited	 Ã‚Â  schools/madrasah	 Ã‚Â  can	 Ã‚Â  issue	 Ã‚Â  official	 Ã‚Â  diplomas	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â 
graduates.	 Ã‚Â There	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â five	 Ã‚Â  levels	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â accreditation:	 Ã‚Â A	 Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€œ	 Ã‚Â E.	 Ã‚Â However,	 Ã‚Â schools/madrasah	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â D	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â E	 Ã‚Â 
accreditation	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â considered	 Ã‚Â accredited.	 Ã‚Â Currently,	 Ã‚Â accreditation	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â conducted	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â National	 Ã‚Â 
Accreditation	 Ã‚Â  Board	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  School/Madrasah	 Ã‚Â  (BAN	 Ã‚Â  S/M)	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  provincial	 Ã‚Â  BAN	 Ã‚Â  S/M	 Ã‚Â  offices,	 Ã‚Â 
financed	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â government	 Ã‚Â  -Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â	 Ã‚Â MOEC	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â MORA.	 Ã‚Â BAN	 Ã‚Â S/M	 Ã‚Â determines	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  target	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â 
accreditation	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â  annual	 Ã‚Â  basis	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  consultation	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â MORA.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â  accreditation	 Ã‚Â data	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  open	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â 
both	 Ã‚Â institutions.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Madrasah	 Ã‚Â accreditation	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â one	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â MORAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â main	 Ã‚Â priorities.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â Strategic	 Ã‚Â Plan	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â DG	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â 
Education	 Ã‚Â 2009-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â2014	 Ã‚Â  set	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  target	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â  RA/BA	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â accredited	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â 2014,	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â 
50%	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â  obtain	 Ã‚Â  accreditation	 Ã‚Â  grades	 Ã‚Â  A	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  B.	 Ã‚Â  By	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  end	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  2013,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  proportion	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â 
accredited	 Ã‚Â madrassas	 Ã‚Â reached	 Ã‚Â 90%	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â MA	 Ã‚Â level,	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 70	 Ã‚Â %	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â MTs	 Ã‚Â level	 Ã‚Â (or	 Ã‚Â 79%	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â 3	 Ã‚Â 
levels	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â madrasah).	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Overall,	 Ã‚Â  48,8%	 Ã‚Â RA/BA	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â  levels	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  given	 Ã‚Â A	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  B	 Ã‚Â  accreditation	 Ã‚Â  grades.	 Ã‚Â 
These	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â closer	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â achieving	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â target	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 50%	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â 2014.	 Ã‚Â

SPM	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â basic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â implemented	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â accordance	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â Ministerial	 Ã‚Â 
Regulation	 Ã‚Â No.	 Ã‚Â 15/2010,	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â was	 Ã‚Â subject	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â minor	 Ã‚Â adjustment	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â Ministerial	 Ã‚Â Regulation	 Ã‚Â 
No.	 Ã‚Â  23/2003.	 Ã‚Â  SPM	 Ã‚Â  policies	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  primary	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  refer	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  general	 Ã‚Â  parameters	 Ã‚Â  specified	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
Ministry	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Home	 Ã‚Â Affairs	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â set	 Ã‚Â minimum	 Ã‚Â service	 Ã‚Â standards	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â several	 Ã‚Â Ministries	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â accordance	 Ã‚Â

	 Ã‚Â 
A	 Ã‚Â  survey	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  2013	 Ã‚Â  found	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  personnel	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  school/madrasah	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  very	 Ã‚Â  limited	 Ã‚Â  knowledge	 Ã‚Â

which	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  relatively	 Ã‚Â better.	 Ã‚Â  Schools	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â Madrasah	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â proved	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â problems	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â meeting	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ MTs,	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  example,	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â difficulty	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â meeting	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  SPM	 Ã‚Â  requirements	 Ã‚Â  related	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â provision	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Data	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  2011/2012	 Ã‚Â  showed	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  more	 Ã‚Â  than	 Ã‚Â  21%	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  madrasah	 Ã‚Â  classrooms	 Ã‚Â  were	 Ã‚Â  severely	 Ã‚Â 

damaged.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Private	 Ã‚Â  madrasah	 Ã‚Â  classrooms	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  more	 Ã‚Â  often	 Ã‚Â  found	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  damaged	 Ã‚Â  than	 Ã‚Â  public	 Ã‚Â  madrasah	 Ã‚Â 

classrooms	 Ã‚Â (28,3%	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â total	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â madrasah).	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ On	 Ã‚Â most	 Ã‚Â levels,	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â shortages	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â text	 Ã‚Â books	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â tools.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Very	 Ã‚Â few	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â permanent	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â time	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â

	 Ã‚Â 
Given	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  limited	 Ã‚Â  resources	 Ã‚Â  available,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  strategic	 Ã‚Â  challenge	 Ã‚Â  encountered	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â MORA	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  providing	 Ã‚Â 
support	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  madrasah	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  meet	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  SPM	 Ã‚Â  related	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  infrastructure,	 Ã‚Â  facilities,	 Ã‚Â  books	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  laboratory	 Ã‚Â

Recommendations	 Ã‚Â 
o MORA	 Ã‚Â should	 Ã‚Â seek	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â mobilize	 Ã‚Â support	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â madrasah,	 Ã‚Â especially	 Ã‚Â private	 Ã‚Â madrasah,	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â lobbying	 Ã‚Â 

the	 Ã‚Â local	 Ã‚Â governments,	 Ã‚Â parents	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â community	 Ã‚Â groups.	 Ã‚Â 
o MORA,	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â limited	 Ã‚Â funds,	 Ã‚Â could	 Ã‚Â provide	 Ã‚Â grants	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â must	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â accompanied	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â counterpart	 Ã‚Â funds	 Ã‚Â 

with	 Ã‚Â self-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âhelp	 Ã‚Â return	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â performance	 Ã‚Â contract	 Ã‚Â models.	 Ã‚Â MORA	 Ã‚Â applied	 Ã‚Â this	 Ã‚Â once	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â improve	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 
quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â diniyah	 Ã‚Â takmiliyah	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â MA.	 Ã‚Â 

o MORA	 Ã‚Â  needs	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  implement	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  training	 Ã‚Â model	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  principals,	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  school	 Ã‚Â  committees,	 Ã‚Â 
such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â program	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â acceleration	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â accreditation,	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â enhance	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â capacity	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â planning	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
fundraising	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â counterpart	 Ã‚Â funds.	 Ã‚Â 

o Another	 Ã‚Â  strategy	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  consider	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  making	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â  agreement	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â  governments	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  transfer	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â 
assign	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â surplus	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â shortage	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â teachers,	 Ã‚Â 
in	 Ã‚Â accordance	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â criteria	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â SPM.	 Ã‚Â 

o The	 Ã‚Â provisions	 Ã‚Â stating	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â minimum	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  teaching	 Ã‚Â hours	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â should	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â 
applied	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â implemented	 Ã‚Â seriously	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â received	 Ã‚Â grant	 Ã‚Â assistance	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â MORA	 Ã‚Â 
or	 Ã‚Â local	 Ã‚Â governments.	 Ã‚Â 

o The	 Ã‚Â data	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â information	 Ã‚Â system	 Ã‚Â used	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â assess	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â extent	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â meet	 Ã‚Â SPM	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â 
needs	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â improved.	 Ã‚Â

It portrayed the current profile of Islamic religious education in Indonesia. Islamic religious education is expected to help prevent inter-faith conflicts in Indonesia by intervening in shaping the understanding school students have about Islam. Religious education is believed to be capable of cultivating values that lead to peaceful coexistence between people of different faiths among young generations while simultaneously preventing the potential for conflict. Although Islam in Indonesia has been praised for being moderate and tolerant, there is evidence that more intolerant and extremist forms of Islam also exist. Extremist tendencies are found less in Islamic education institutions than in general education institutions, both private and state. The main entry channels through which radicalism enters schools are radical Islamic community organizations, which have increased in number and activity. This document introduced findings of recent studies on religious radicalism and Islamic religious education in Indonesia, and suggested key solutions.</p>

Catatan ini menggambarkan profil pendidikan agama Islam di Indonesia saat ini. Pendidikan agama Islam diharapkan dapat membantu mencegah konflik antar agama di Indonesia dengan melakukan intervensi dalam membentuk pemahaman siswa sekolah tentang Islam. Pendidikan agama diyakini mampu menumbuhkan nilai-nilai hidup berdampingan secara damai antara orang-orang dengan agama yang berbeda di antara generasi muda, sekaligus mencegah potensi konflik. Meskipun Islam di Indonesia dipuji karena moderat dan toleran, terdapat bukti bahwa bentuk intoleransi dan ekstrimis Islam pun ada. Kecenderungan ekstremisme tidak banyak ditemukan dalam lembaga-lembaga pendidikan Islam dibanding dengan lembaga pendidikan umum, baik swasta maupun negeri. Saluran masuk utama radikalisme memasuki sekolah adalah melalui organisasi-organisasi masyarakat Islam radikal, yang telah meningkat dalam jumlah dan aktivitas.

Background	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â system,	 Ã‚Â comprised	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â thousands	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â institutions	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â millions	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
students,	 Ã‚Â  makes	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  substantial	 Ã‚Â  contribution	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â  achieving	 Ã‚Â  universal	 Ã‚Â  basic	 Ã‚Â 
education.	 Ã‚Â  Between	 Ã‚Â  2008/2009-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â2012/2013,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  total	 Ã‚Â  number	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  enrollments	 Ã‚Â  at	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â  pre-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â
tertiary	 Ã‚Â  level	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  institutions	 Ã‚Â  increased	 Ã‚Â  16.4%,	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  7,073,370	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  8,230,788	 Ã‚Â 
students.	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â one	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â few	 Ã‚Â countries	 Ã‚Â where	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â  legally	 Ã‚Â required	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â 
form	 Ã‚Â  part	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  system,	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  intended	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  integrate	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  values	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â 
education	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â social	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â sciences.	 Ã‚Â According	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â scholar,	 Ã‚Â Azyumardi	 Ã‚Â Azra:	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Indonesian	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  product	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  preserver	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Ã¢â‚¬ËœIndonesian	 Ã‚Â  IslamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â

Radicalism	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â Religious	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Islamic	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â expected	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â help	 Ã‚Â prevent	 Ã‚Â  inter-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âfaith	 Ã‚Â  conflicts	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â

between	 Ã‚Â  people	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  different	 Ã‚Â  faiths	 Ã‚Â  among	 Ã‚Â  young	 Ã‚Â  generations	 Ã‚Â  while	 Ã‚Â  simultaneously	 Ã‚Â 
preventing	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â potential	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â conflict.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Although	 Ã‚Â  Islam	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  praised	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  being	 Ã‚Â  moderate	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  tolerant,	 Ã‚Â  there	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â 
evidence	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â intolerant	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â extremist	 Ã‚Â forms	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Islam	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â exist.	 Ã‚Â Extremist	 Ã‚Â tendencies	 Ã‚Â 
are	 Ã‚Â  found	 Ã‚Â  less	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â  institutions	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â general	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â  institutions,	 Ã‚Â both	 Ã‚Â 
private	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  state.	 Ã‚Â  Although	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  current	 Ã‚Â  study	 Ã‚Â  revealed	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  only	 Ã‚Â  30%	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â 
influenced	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  radicalism,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  impact	 Ã‚Â  could	 Ã‚Â  expand,	 Ã‚Â  if	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  anticipated.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â  main	 Ã‚Â  entry	 Ã‚Â 
channels	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  which	 Ã‚Â  radicalism	 Ã‚Â  enters	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  radical	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  community	 Ã‚Â

	 Ã‚Â 
MoRA	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â especially	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Directorate	 Ã‚Â General	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â (DGIE)	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â mandate	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â 
manage	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â way	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â promotes	 Ã‚Â character	 Ã‚Â building	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â inhibits	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â spread	 Ã‚Â 



of	 Ã‚Â  radical	 Ã‚Â  ideologies	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  efforts	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  managing	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  supervising	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â 
curricula	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â extra-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âcurricular	 Ã‚Â programs	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â pre-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âtertiary	 Ã‚Â level.	 Ã‚Â However,	 Ã‚Â lack	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â resources	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â clarity	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â some	 Ã‚Â legal	 Ã‚Â regulations	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â prevented	 Ã‚Â DGIE	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â fully	 Ã‚Â carrying	 Ã‚Â out	 Ã‚Â this	 Ã‚Â role.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Some	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  findings	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  recent	 Ã‚Â  studies	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  radicalism	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â 
education	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â presented	 Ã‚Â below:	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
1. Radical	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  community	 Ã‚Â  organizations	 Ã‚Â  can	 Ã‚Â  interpret	 Ã‚Â  Islam	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  its	 Ã‚Â  relationship	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â 

daily	 Ã‚Â  life	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â way	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  differs	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  presentation	 Ã‚Â  students	 Ã‚Â  receive	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  school.	 Ã‚Â When	 Ã‚Â 
radical	 Ã‚Â  interpretations	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Islam	 Ã‚Â  offer	 Ã‚Â  simple	 Ã‚Â  explanations	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  complex	 Ã‚Â  issues	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â 
pluralism	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â tolerance,	 Ã‚Â these	 Ã‚Â interpretations	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â attractive.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â Thus,	 Ã‚Â Islam	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â taught	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â 
these	 Ã‚Â organizations	 Ã‚Â could	 Ã‚Â potentially	 Ã‚Â compete	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â religious	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â given	 Ã‚Â 
in	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  It	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  important	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  note	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  community	 Ã‚Â  organizations	 Ã‚Â  offer	 Ã‚Â 
radical	 Ã‚Â  understandings	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Islam.	 Ã‚Â  Many	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  community	 Ã‚Â  organizations	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  moderate	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â many	 Ã‚Â followers	 Ã‚Â including	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â regular	 Ã‚Â schools.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
2. Another	 Ã‚Â  channel	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  radical	 Ã‚Â message	 Ã‚Â  infiltrates	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  indirectly,	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â 

source	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â external	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â school,	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â mass	 Ã‚Â media,	 Ã‚Â especially	 Ã‚Â television,	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â 
well	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  parents	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  family	 Ã‚Â  members,	 Ã‚Â  neighbors,	 Ã‚Â  extra-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âcurricular	 Ã‚Â  student	 Ã‚Â 
organizations	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â extra-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âcurricular	 Ã‚Â activities	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  schools.	 Ã‚Â  Television	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â  radio	 Ã‚Â  tend	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â 
be	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â most	 Ã‚Â popular	 Ã‚Â among	 Ã‚Â these	 Ã‚Â channels.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
3. Community	 Ã‚Â organizations	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â attractive	 Ã‚Â because	 Ã‚Â they	 Ã‚Â offer	 Ã‚Â kinship,	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â young	 Ã‚Â 

students	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â SMP	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â drawn.	 Ã‚Â A	 Ã‚Â collegial	 Ã‚Â kinship	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â  form	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â social	 Ã‚Â contact	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â 
many	 Ã‚Â  youngsters	 Ã‚Â  prefer	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  inspires	 Ã‚Â  them	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  actively	 Ã‚Â  involved	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  various	 Ã‚Â 
organizations,	 Ã‚Â including	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â radical	 Ã‚Â community	 Ã‚Â organizations.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
4. One	 Ã‚Â way	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â mitigating	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  influence	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  radical	 Ã‚Â  views	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â employ	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â wisdom,	 Ã‚Â  if	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â 

wisdom	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  helpful	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  facilitating	 Ã‚Â  tolerance	 Ã‚Â  amongst	 Ã‚Â  pluralistic	 Ã‚Â  communities.	 Ã‚Â  In	 Ã‚Â 
North	 Ã‚Â  Sulawesi,	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  example,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â motto	 Ã‚Â  used	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Torang	 Ã‚Â  Samua	 Ã‚Â  BasudaraÃ¢â‚¬Â	 Ã‚Â  (we	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â 
families).	 Ã‚Â Another	 Ã‚Â example	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â Medan,	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â adopts	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â tolerant	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â  inclusive	 Ã‚Â perspective	 Ã‚Â 
on	 Ã‚Â inter-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âfaith	 Ã‚Â relationships	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â upholding	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â marga	 Ã‚Â (clan).	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
5. The	 Ã‚Â  Center	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  Curriculum	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  Books	 Ã‚Â  (PusKurBuk)	 Ã‚Â  under	 Ã‚Â  MoEC	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  responsible	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 

curriculum	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  textbooks	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia.	 Ã‚Â  Certain	 Ã‚Â MoRA	 Ã‚Â  staff	 Ã‚Â members	 Ã‚Â  were	 Ã‚Â  involved	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â 
developing	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  content	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  subjects	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  writing	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  texts	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  teachersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â 
guides.	 Ã‚Â  However,	 Ã‚Â  involvement	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  MoRA	 Ã‚Â  was	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  result	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â  institutional	 Ã‚Â 
collaboration,	 Ã‚Â but	 Ã‚Â only	 Ã‚Â collaboration	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â personal	 Ã‚Â basis.	 Ã‚Â As	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â result,	 Ã‚Â some	 Ã‚Â dissatisfaction	 Ã‚Â 
has	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â expressed	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â accuracy	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â presentation	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â some	 Ã‚Â religious	 Ã‚Â 
topics	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â textbooks.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
Recommendations:	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
1. Expanding	 Ã‚Â MoRAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â authority	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â supervise	 Ã‚Â unstructured	 Ã‚Â extra-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âcurricular	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â teachings	 Ã‚Â 

and	 Ã‚Â activities	 Ã‚Â conducted	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â school	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â announced	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â promoted	 Ã‚Â within	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â school.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
2. Supporting	 Ã‚Â  MoRA	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  reasserting	 Ã‚Â  its	 Ã‚Â  institutional	 Ã‚Â  mandate	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  produce	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â 

teaching/learning	 Ã‚Â materials	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  general	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  review	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  content	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  non-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â
religion	 Ã‚Â subjects	 Ã‚Â such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â civics.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 



3. Enriching	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â curriculum	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â religious	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â used	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â so	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â content	 Ã‚Â includes	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â values	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â culture	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â peace.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
4. Improving	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  professional	 Ã‚Â  competencies	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  religious	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  include	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â 

teaching	 Ã‚Â methodology	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â  find	 Ã‚Â attractive	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â  facilitates	 Ã‚Â critical	 Ã‚Â  thinking,	 Ã‚Â 
problem	 Ã‚Â solving	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â approach	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  teaching	 Ã‚Â  Islam	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â places	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  context	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â 
beliefs	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â social	 Ã‚Â developments.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
5. 	 Ã‚Â Ensuring	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  content	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  curriculum	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â  interpretation	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  rukun	 Ã‚Â  iman	 Ã‚Â  (pillars	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â 

faith)	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  rukun	 Ã‚Â  Islam	 Ã‚Â  (Islamic	 Ã‚Â  five	 Ã‚Â  essential	 Ã‚Â  pillars)	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â perspective	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  values	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â culture	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â peace.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â curriculum	 Ã‚Â content	 Ã‚Â should	 Ã‚Â refer	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â lessons	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â drawn	 Ã‚Â 
from	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  global	 Ã‚Â  history	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Islamic	 Ã‚Â  history	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  well	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  relevant	 Ã‚Â 
conceptual	 Ã‚Â thinking	 Ã‚Â surrounding	 Ã‚Â international	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â national	 Ã‚Â Islamic	 Ã‚Â figures.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
6. Ensuring	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â above	 Ã‚Â initiatives	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â backed	 Ã‚Â up	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â appropriate	 Ã‚Â policy,	 Ã‚Â legislation	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 

clear	 Ã‚Â implementation	 Ã‚Â guidelines.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â

What	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â Early	 Ã‚Â Childhood	 Ã‚Â Development	 Ã‚Â (ECD)	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Holistic	 Ã‚Â Integrated	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â (HI	 Ã‚Â ECD)?	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
International	 Ã‚Â  educational	 Ã‚Â  research	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  recent	 Ã‚Â  findings	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  cognitive	 Ã‚Â  science	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  highlighted	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
importance	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â advantage	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â early	 Ã‚Â childhood	 Ã‚Â development	 Ã‚Â (ECD).	 Ã‚Â From	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â period	 Ã‚Â before	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â child	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â 
born	 Ã‚Â  until	 Ã‚Â  their	 Ã‚Â  eighth	 Ã‚Â  birthday,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  central	 Ã‚Â  nervous	 Ã‚Â  system,	 Ã‚Â  brain	 Ã‚Â  cells	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  neural	 Ã‚Â  pathways	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â 
being	 Ã‚Â  established.	 Ã‚Â  During	 Ã‚Â  this	 Ã‚Â  critical	 Ã‚Â  period	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  brain	 Ã‚Â  development,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  foundation	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â 
future	 Ã‚Â  life	 Ã‚Â  trajectory	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  set.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â magnitude	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  benefits	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  derive	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  cognitive	 Ã‚Â  stimulation	 Ã‚Â 
provided	 Ã‚Â during	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â ages	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 0-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â4	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â led	 Ã‚Â researchers	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â call	 Ã‚Â this	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgolden	 Ã‚Â periodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â development	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â 
which	 Ã‚Â cognitive,	 Ã‚Â social	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â emotional	 Ã‚Â development	 Ã‚Â takes	 Ã‚Â place	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â affect	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â health,	 Ã‚Â  learning	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â  behavior	 Ã‚Â  throughout	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â  life.	 Ã‚Â  Cognitive	 Ã‚Â  neuroscientists	 Ã‚Â  refer	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“use	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  lose	 Ã‚Â  itÃ¢â‚¬Â	 Ã‚Â

time,	 Ã‚Â there	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â irreparable	 Ã‚Â damage	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â individual	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â school	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â later	 Ã‚Â life.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Early	 Ã‚Â childhood	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â most	 Ã‚Â effective	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â cost	 Ã‚Â efficient	 Ã‚Â means	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â time	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â intervene	 Ã‚Â 
to	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â possibility	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â fully	 Ã‚Â benefit	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â school.	 Ã‚Â In	 Ã‚Â unequal	 Ã‚Â societies	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â high	 Ã‚Â levels	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
poverty,	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â time	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â child	 Ã‚Â enters	 Ã‚Â school,	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â may	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â too	 Ã‚Â already	 Ã‚Â unfair	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â poor	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â 
address	 Ã‚Â  inequalities	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  break	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  intergenerational	 Ã‚Â  cycle	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  poverty.	 Ã‚Â  These	 Ã‚Â  risks	 Ã‚Â  lead	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â 
lifetime	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â differences	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â underprivileged	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â  significantly	 Ã‚Â  reduce	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â  childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â  chances	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â 
life.	 Ã‚Â  It	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  found	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  	 Ã‚Â  pre-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âschool	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  can	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  significant	 Ã‚Â  effect	 Ã‚Â  	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  test	 Ã‚Â  scores	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â 
children	 Ã‚Â  at	 Ã‚Â  11,	 Ã‚Â  14	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  16	 Ã‚Â  years	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  age,	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  this	 Ã‚Â  benefit	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  most	 Ã‚Â  marked	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  children	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â 
disadvantaged	 Ã‚Â backgrounds.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Parents	 Ã‚Â mostly	 Ã‚Â believe	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â their	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â benefit	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â services.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â However,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â understanding	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
ECD	 Ã‚Â among	 Ã‚Â parents	 Ã‚Â varies.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â A	 Ã‚Â common	 Ã‚Â misunderstanding	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â many	 Ã‚Â parents	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â 
of	 Ã‚Â  ECD	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  measured	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  learning	 Ã‚Â  outcomes	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  literacy	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  numeracy	 Ã‚Â  at	 Ã‚Â  this	 Ã‚Â  early	 Ã‚Â  stage.	 Ã‚Â  This	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â

Who	 Ã‚Â participates	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â HI	 Ã‚Â ECD?	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
In	 Ã‚Â recent	 Ã‚Â years,	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â experienced	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â rapid	 Ã‚Â increase	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â participating	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â 
playgroups,	 Ã‚Â kindergartens	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â childcare	 Ã‚Â services,	 Ã‚Â mostly	 Ã‚Â due	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â active	 Ã‚Â promotion	 Ã‚Â 
of	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  services.	 Ã‚Â  	 Ã‚Â  According	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  recent	 Ã‚Â  Puslitjakdikbud	 Ã‚Â  report,	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  2004/2005,	 Ã‚Â  only	 Ã‚Â  25.3%,	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  7.2	 Ã‚Â 
million	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 28.2	 Ã‚Â million	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â aged	 Ã‚Â 0-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â6	 Ã‚Â received	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â services,	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â only	 Ã‚Â 32.26%,	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â 2.63	 Ã‚Â million	 Ã‚Â 
children	 Ã‚Â aged	 Ã‚Â 5-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â6	 Ã‚Â years	 Ã‚Â had	 Ã‚Â received	 Ã‚Â ECD.	 Ã‚Â In	 Ã‚Â contrast,	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â 2010,	 Ã‚Â around	 Ã‚Â 57%	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â five	 Ã‚Â years	 Ã‚Â 
of	 Ã‚Â age	 Ã‚Â had	 Ã‚Â attended	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â formal	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â non-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âformal	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â center.	 Ã‚Â Participation	 Ã‚Â was	 Ã‚Â lower	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â four	 Ã‚Â 
years	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â age	 Ã‚Â (35%)	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â three	 Ã‚Â years	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â age	 Ã‚Â (11%).	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â greatest	 Ã‚Â proportion	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â early-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyears	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â 
provided	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  kindergartens,	 Ã‚Â  followed	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  playgroups.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â  number	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  kindergarten	 Ã‚Â  institutions	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â 
than	 Ã‚Â doubled	 Ã‚Â between	 Ã‚Â 2000	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 2011.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Participation	 Ã‚Â  rates	 Ã‚Â  vary	 Ã‚Â  considerably	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  region	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â wealth.	 Ã‚Â  70%	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  richest	 Ã‚Â  20%	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  households	 Ã‚Â 
were	 Ã‚Â shown	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â participate,	 Ã‚Â while	 Ã‚Â 45%	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â poorest	 Ã‚Â 20%	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â households	 Ã‚Â were,	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â there	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â  large	 Ã‚Â 
regional	 Ã‚Â  disparities.	 Ã‚Â  Participation	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  also	 Ã‚Â  determined	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  level.	 Ã‚Â  A	 Ã‚Â  child	 Ã‚Â whose	 Ã‚Â 
mother	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â  least	 Ã‚Â completed	 Ã‚Â primary	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â 30%	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â likely	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â participate	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â TK	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â 
age	 Ã‚Â 5.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â According	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â Puslitjak	 Ã‚Â research,	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â access	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â determined	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â familiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â distance	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â school	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â transportation	 Ã‚Â costs.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Who	 Ã‚Â provides	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â HI	 Ã‚Â ECD?	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
ECD	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  provided	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  formal	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â non-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âformal	 Ã‚Â  settings.	 Ã‚Â However,	 Ã‚Â much	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â early-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyears	 Ã‚Â provision	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â 
Indonesia	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â provided	 Ã‚Â outside	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â formal	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â health	 Ã‚Â sectors.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
In	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  recent	 Ã‚Â  ACDP	 Ã‚Â  qualitative	 Ã‚Â  research	 Ã‚Â  exercise	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  four-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âsites,	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â  attempt	 Ã‚Â was	 Ã‚Â made	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  distinguish	 Ã‚Â 
between	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â different	 Ã‚Â  types	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â centers	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â had	 Ã‚Â evolved	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  communities.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â  study	 Ã‚Â aimed	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â 
differentiate	 Ã‚Â between	 Ã‚Â those	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â had	 Ã‚Â developed	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â result	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â community	 Ã‚Â efforts	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â those	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â had	 Ã‚Â 
developed	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  result	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â  institutional	 Ã‚Â  grant	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  support	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â Government	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia,	 Ã‚Â 
Multilateral	 Ã‚Â Donors	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â NGO	 Ã‚Â funding.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â  study	 Ã‚Â  showed	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  institutionally	 Ã‚Â  driven	 Ã‚Â  (usually	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  government	 Ã‚Â  sector	 Ã‚Â  but	 Ã‚Â  also	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  private	 Ã‚Â 
institutions	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â civil	 Ã‚Â society	 Ã‚Â institutions)	 Ã‚Â approaches	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â demonstrated	 Ã‚Â quick	 Ã‚Â improvements	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â 
participation	 Ã‚Â  rates.	 Ã‚Â  However,	 Ã‚Â  some	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  these	 Ã‚Â  achievements	 Ã‚Â  may	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  sustainable	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  they	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â 
dependent	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â short-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âterm	 Ã‚Â financing.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Communities	 Ã‚Â were	 Ã‚Â found	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â capable	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â developing	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â HI	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â initiatives	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â their	 Ã‚Â own,	 Ã‚Â but	 Ã‚Â 
they	 Ã‚Â  required	 Ã‚Â  much	 Ã‚Â  more	 Ã‚Â  investment	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  time	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  skilled	 Ã‚Â  facilitators	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  frequently	 Ã‚Â  benefit	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â 
external	 Ã‚Â input	 Ã‚Â either	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â funding	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â capacity	 Ã‚Â building.	 Ã‚Â While	 Ã‚Â they	 Ã‚Â do	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â produce	 Ã‚Â quick	 Ã‚Â results,	 Ã‚Â 
community	 Ã‚Â  initiated	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  	 Ã‚Â managed	 Ã‚Â  initiatives	 Ã‚Â  produce	 Ã‚Â  	 Ã‚Â  outcomes	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  generally	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â  holistic	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â sustainable.	 Ã‚Â

Other	 Ã‚Â Opportunities	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Challenges	 Ã‚Â related	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â Local	 Ã‚Â Delivery	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Decentralisation	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  allowed	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â  governments	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â  flexibility	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  determining	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  strategies	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â 
allow	 Ã‚Â them	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â meet	 Ã‚Â local	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â national	 Ã‚Â development	 Ã‚Â objectives.	 Ã‚Â Only	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â local	 Ã‚Â level	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â decisions	 Ã‚Â 
be	 Ã‚Â made	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  how	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â most	 Ã‚Â  effectively	 Ã‚Â  link	 Ã‚Â  services	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  given	 Ã‚Â  village	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â what	 Ã‚Â  kind	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  ECD	 Ã‚Â  best	 Ã‚Â 
capitalizes	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  existing	 Ã‚Â  investments	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  facilities.	 Ã‚Â  Although	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â  regulations	 Ã‚Â  often	 Ã‚Â  focus	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  single-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â
sector	 Ã‚Â interventions,	 Ã‚Â there	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â emerging	 Ã‚Â trend	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â local	 Ã‚Â legislation	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â regulation	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â support	 Ã‚Â HI	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â 
at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â district	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â provincial	 Ã‚Â levels.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
However,	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â difficult	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  coordinate	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  align	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â many	 Ã‚Â  institutions	 Ã‚Â  involved	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â HI	 Ã‚Â 
ECD	 Ã‚Â provision	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â central	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â provincial	 Ã‚Â levels,	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â makes	 Ã‚Â coordination	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â implementation	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â district	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â community	 Ã‚Â  level	 Ã‚Â problematic.	 Ã‚Â  	 Ã‚Â  In	 Ã‚Â addition	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â  lack	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â coordination,	 Ã‚Â overlapping	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â

sometimes	 Ã‚Â unclear	 Ã‚Â responsibilities	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â different	 Ã‚Â bodies	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â central,	 Ã‚Â provincial	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â district	 Ã‚Â level	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â 
hampered	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â efficient	 Ã‚Â functioning	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â ECD,	 Ã‚Â let	 Ã‚Â alone	 Ã‚Â HI	 Ã‚Â ECD.	 Ã‚Â Regardless	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â capacity	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
commitment	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â  officials,	 Ã‚Â  there	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  significant	 Ã‚Â  institutional	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  administrative	 Ã‚Â  challenges	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â 
working	 Ã‚Â  across	 Ã‚Â  sectors,	 Ã‚Â  especially	 Ã‚Â  when	 Ã‚Â  working	 Ã‚Â  directly	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â  communities	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  way	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  would	 Ã‚Â 
deliver	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â mix	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â health	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â services	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â described	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â National	 Ã‚Â Strategy.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
HI	 Ã‚Â  ECD	 Ã‚Â  cannot	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  realized	 Ã‚Â without	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â  informed	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  systematic	 Ã‚Â  process	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  decision-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âmaking	 Ã‚Â  at	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
local	 Ã‚Â  level.	 Ã‚Â Yet,	 Ã‚Â  there	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â no	 Ã‚Â current	 Ã‚Â development	 Ã‚Â model	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â creating	 Ã‚Â sustainable	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â  level	 Ã‚Â support	 Ã‚Â 
for	 Ã‚Â HI	 Ã‚Â ECD.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
How	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â ECD/HI	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â financed?	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â financing	 Ã‚Â model	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â complex.	 Ã‚Â Public	 Ã‚Â investment	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â clearly	 Ã‚Â contributed	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â expansion	 Ã‚Â 
of	 Ã‚Â ECD,	 Ã‚Â but	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â may	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â targeted	 Ã‚Â well	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  improve	 Ã‚Â equity.	 Ã‚Â Current	 Ã‚Â  financing	 Ã‚Â models	 Ã‚Â tend	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â favor	 Ã‚Â 
centers	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â  more	 Ã‚Â  capacity	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  self-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âfinancing	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  public	 Ã‚Â  support	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  training	 Ã‚Â  materials	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â 
operational	 Ã‚Â support	 Ã‚Â over	 Ã‚Â less	 Ã‚Â well-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âdeveloped	 Ã‚Â centers	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â lower	 Ã‚Â capacity	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â generate	 Ã‚Â revenue.	 Ã‚Â 
Maternal	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â child	 Ã‚Â health	 Ã‚Â components	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â HI	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â favorably	 Ã‚Â resourced	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â ECD.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Public	 Ã‚Â investment	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â point	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â delivery	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â dependent	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â transfers	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â National	 Ã‚Â budget.	 Ã‚Â 90%	 Ã‚Â 
of	 Ã‚Â  revenues	 Ã‚Â accrue	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â national	 Ã‚Â  transfers	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â estimated	 Ã‚Â 60%	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â activities	 Ã‚Â  implemented	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
community	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â executed	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â national	 Ã‚Â  entity.	 Ã‚Â While	 Ã‚Â  investment	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â well	 Ã‚Â  below	 Ã‚Â 
investment	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â basic	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â upper	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â education,	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â 2011	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 2012,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â national	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â provided	 Ã‚Â 
operational	 Ã‚Â  subsidies	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  about	 Ã‚Â  1.9	 Ã‚Â  million	 Ã‚Â  children	 Ã‚Â  (per	 Ã‚Â  year)	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  invested	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  model	 Ã‚Â  programs	 Ã‚Â 
throughout	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  country	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  terms	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  improving	 Ã‚Â  facilities	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  developing	 Ã‚Â  programs.	 Ã‚Â  However,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
functioning	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â many	 Ã‚Â centers	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â only	 Ã‚Â possible	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â voluntary	 Ã‚Â labor	 Ã‚Â given	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â caregivers.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
What	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â HI	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â provided?	 Ã‚Â

According	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â recent	 Ã‚Â ACDP	 Ã‚Â study	 Ã‚Â conducted	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â four	 Ã‚Â selected	 Ã‚Â districts,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â provision	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â high	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â 
ECD	 Ã‚Â  services	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  still	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â major	 Ã‚Â  challenge	 Ã‚Â  facing	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia.	 Ã‚Â  Initial	 Ã‚Â  steps	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â  taken	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â develop	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â 
quality	 Ã‚Â  assurance	 Ã‚Â  system.	 Ã‚Â At	 Ã‚Â  this	 Ã‚Â  stage,	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  critical	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â ensure	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â effective	 Ã‚Â  implementation	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
presidential	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â ministerial	 Ã‚Â regulations	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â provide	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â framework	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â this	 Ã‚Â system,	 Ã‚Â particularly	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 
decentralized	 Ã‚Â district	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â community	 Ã‚Â levels.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â study	 Ã‚Â found	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â many	 Ã‚Â non-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âformal	 Ã‚Â ECD	 Ã‚Â institutions	 Ã‚Â 
have	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â unable	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â meet	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â eight	 Ã‚Â standards	 Ã‚Â set	 Ã‚Â out	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Ministerial	 Ã‚Â decree	 Ã‚Â No.	 Ã‚Â 137.	 Ã‚Â Another	 Ã‚Â

are	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â important	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â providing	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â this	 Ã‚Â level	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â formal	 Ã‚Â qualifications.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â

Topic #14 
 
Acquire Knowledge from Teachers Who Never Stop Learning 
 

 
Teacher as key player in education 
 

Improving the quality of education must be a priority of national development, which includes 
revamping the governance of teachers as key player in education. As Minister of Education and 
Culture Anies Baswedan has stated to commemorate the National Teacher Day 2015, teachers play 
an important role in shaping the character of the nation. Indonesian teachers should be teacher who 
never stop learning who are always present both as an educator and as a leader for their students. 
The changing dynamics of the world requires teachers to continue to learn in order to keep up with 
the 21st century demands. 
 

The Teacher Law of 2005, which emphasized that all teachers gain certification, has attempted to 
comprehensively address the issue of teacher quality improvement by linking a range of strategies to 
the powerful incentive of a significant increase in income. While this law represents a positive 
change, it has not effectively empowered teachers to improve student learning outcomes, which 
have remained the same since the enactment of the law.  Further, while the law does allow for a 
salary increase for teachers who gain the right qualifications and certification, it does not provide for 
incentives for high performing teachers after initial certification is gained. 
 

According to Professor of International Education and Development at the University of Sussex, 
Keith Lewin, spending efficiently to empower teachers to improve their practices entails providing 
incentives throughout the course of a teacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career and spending more heavily on teachers who 
have remained in the teaching profession than on teachers just entering the profession.  
 

On the other side, teachers and education personnel must be able to innovate and make changes to 
improve teaching and learning process. In fact, Indonesia have a fair amount of impeccable teachers 
and education personnel who have done remarkable breakthrough, became an example and 
inspiration for the community, and managed to instill a new culture in education environment. 
 

Challenges 
 

The 2014 ASEAN Business Outlook Survey identified Indonesia as the top destination in ASEAN for 
business investment. However, the same survey identified IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key strength as its low skilled 
and low cost labour.  
 

Indonesians will not be competitive and will lose the best jobs to graduates from countries such as 
The Philippines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which was ranked positively for having trained labour Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if Indonesian teachers are 
not supported in producing more highly skilled graduates. To help improve the situation, improving 
the quality of education must continue to be a priority of national development which includes 
improvement of teacher governance. 
 

Many Indonesian teachers were hired in the 1970s-80s with low levels of initial education and 
exposure to a school culture that rewarded passivity and loyalty rather than empowerment and

proactive and innovative approaches to improving student outcomes. Majority of these teachers still 
had another decade or more to work but little incentive and few opportunities for further 
professional development. 
 

Over the last ten years, significant progress has been made in implementing a comprehensive 
education reform agenda; In 2001, the responsibility for many aspects of basic education service 
delivery was devolved to local governments. Further reforms were introduced in 2003 that provided 
the legal basis for school based management and formalized school committees in an effort to 
encourage local community participation and to strengthen accountability of schools to their 
communities; The Teacher Law of 2005 addressed shortcomings in teacher pay and quality by 
introducing certification and a strengthened program of continuous professional development; At 
the same time, the national school grants program (BOS) was rolled-out and gave schools vital 
resources to support their adoption of earlier school based management reforms. These three 
reforms brought the Indonesian system of education in line with modern education world-wide. 
 

The teacher law and the certification program have increased the proportion of teachers with a 
bachelorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree from 36% to 63% between 2006 and 2012. While increased investment has led to 
some notable achievements in increasing educational opportunity, changes in learning achievement 
have been more mixed. This improvement in teacher qualifications is expected to improve the 
quality of teaching in the long-term.  
 

Teacher empowerment 
 

In preparing young people for the workforce and for productive lives, the education system must 
include deliberate teaching of non-cognitive skills including character skills and the so-called 21st 
century learning skills. A considerable body of educational research suggests that non-cognitive skills 
(e.g. persistence, selfdiscipline, effective communication) are equally if not more influential than 
academic skills in predicting post-school outcomes.  
 

The reform of the teaching process can happen school by school, day by day, through the way that 
individual teachers, principals, supervisors and district officials view their job and take responsibility 
for their actions. This approach is consistent with the Mental Revolution proposed by President Joko 
Widodo, which calls for a new mindset in which citizens, including teachers and education officials, 
are empowered to make moral choices and behave in ways that will improve teaching and learning. 
Principals, school supervisors and teachers themselves must be the leaders of change in this organic 
school by school process which reaches into to every classroom.  
 

Principals and teachers however cannot do this alone. They must be supported by a system that 
values and supports teachers through its selection methods, pre-service training, induction, school-
based development procedures and effective performance management. National and local 
government must work together to ensure more effective management and deployment of the 
teaching workforce. This will result in more students having quality teachers who feel valued and act 
as professionals.

Topic #15 
 

 
Realizing Excellent and Moderate Islamic Education in Indonesia to serve as a World 
Reference in Integrating Religious Study, Science and Technology 
 

 
Background 

Historically, Islamic Education in Indonesia started from of pesantren (Islamic boarding school), a non-
governmental organization that played a role not only as a provider of Islamic religious education but 
also a driver for community empowerment, and a center for Islamic civilization. As an educational 
institution, pesantrens have provided outstanding contributions in providing Islamic religious education 
services, especially in rural areas reaching out to children from disadvantaged families. 
 
By embracing the ideology of ""al-muhafadzatu bil-qadimish-shalih wal-akhdzu bil-jadidil-ashlah"",1  
pesantrens underline the creativity of its community in response to the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development so that it 
can still evolve dynamically while maintaining its traditional values2 -- as educational center, which 
organizes various types of education, community development centers, as well as center of Islamic 
civilization. As an educational institution, pesantren originally only focused on Islamic religious education 
by using its religious book (Kitab Kuning or the Yellow Book) and halaqah (sitting in a semi-circle around 
a seated teacher), and then subsequently became Madrasah by incorporating general science. During 
the early 20th century many pesantrens set up schools which then partially evolved as Integrated Islamic 
Schools (Sekolah Islam Terpadu). The Integrated Islamic Schools provide education starting from pre-
school through senior high school that combines general education in the morning, and Islamic religious 
education in the afternoon and evenings. In fact, some pesantrens combine both types of activities in 
the form of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“boarding schoolÃ¢â‚¬Â.3 The existing system in madrasahs, which is rooted in the culture of 
pesantren, has even been adopted by public schools carrying distinctive Islamic characteristics. 
 
Given pesantrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rapid growth, the government has responded pesantrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s increased role as an 
education institution by incorporating Islamic religious education program and Madrasah, which initially 
was outside the system, into the National Education System. Law 20 of 2003 on National Education 
System has positioned religious education, including Islamic religious education, as an integral part of 
the national education System.4 In fact, in order to improve service quality of religious education, the 
Ministry of Religious Affairs has issued regulations that arrange the institutional aspect and programs of 
pesantrens within the framework of the National Education System, under the regulations of Minister of 
Religious Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia (Permenag) 13 of 2014 on the Islamic Religious Education 
and number 18 of 2014 on MuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢adalah Education Unit in Pondok Pesantren. Both regulations stipulate 
the institutional requirements for pesantrens, types, levels of education and their requirements, 
curriculum, and delivery.

religious, and special educationÃ¢â‚¬Â.

As a center for community development with its flexibility to adapt, pesantrens continue to evolve by 
following the socio-political development of the state. In the 1980s, under the Kyai (the leader of the 
school), pesantrens not only acted as a ""cultural intermediariesÃ¢â‚¬Â that are passive towards ""Javanese 
ethnic religions"", and of the surrounding communities, but they also became agents of social change by 
encouraging pesantrens and surrounding communities to be open to the outside world. They relied on 
classic wisdoms, which preserved the good from old traditions and taking away what is better from the 
new ways.5 During the New Order era, community development was undertaken in a large scale using 
the mobility of education. This development was characterized by improved access to education for 
Muslim communities through madrasahs, which since 1989 had equal status to general schools.6 The 
proportion of Madrasah students started to increase sharply from about 11% in 1980 to about 20% in 
2000. It was also similar at the higher education level, which was referred to as the era of ""Moslem 
intellectual boom"" by Ridwan Saidi.7 

 
Pesantren within the context of social mobility through education have produced scholars, intellectuals 
and elites from Islamic groups, which according to Robert W. Hefner (2000:1), was referred to as 
""Islamic revival that has never happened in the course of history.""8 Such Islamic revival is partly 
characterized by the emergence of a range of new ways of thinking in politics, which is to: 
 

(i) review the theological foundation of political Islam, 
(ii) redefine the ideals of political Islam, and 
(iii) conduct a reassessment of how the ideals of political Islam can be effectively achieved.9 

 
By having modality for social mobility through education, santris or pesantren students (and alumni) 
have more opportunity to have social mobility in other fields - either politics, religion, and social. In the 
political field, many pesantren elites have been involved in practical political activities under political 
parties to compete for power at particular political levels and institutions such as running for governor, 
regent/mayor, members of DPR and DPRD, and even competing for strategic positions in the ministry. In 
other words, social mobility occurs not only vertically but also horizontally, from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ulama"" (theologians) 
to ""Umaro"" (leaders). In the religious field, pesantren graduates have managed to improve the position 
of ""Dai"" to a position that is more respectable and has a viable income. Within social institutions, alumni 
of pesantrens have also succeeded in building dynamic ""pressure groups"" as a counterweight to the 
government. 
 
Moreover, as center for community empowerment, pesantren have also provided life skills for their 
santris and the surrounding community. However, this role has diminished over time as pesantrens are 
no longer able to keep up with technology updates. Consequentially, the programs, which pesantrens 
offer, are no longer attractive; a growing number of santris receives the opportunity to pursue higher 
education; and the number of supporting facilities and infrastructures becomes limited. 

 
The Revival of Islamic Education 
 
As the center of Islamic civilization, pesantrens have managed to add color to the development of 
Islamic civilization Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and even to Malayan and Javanese civilization in three ways. First, the use of 
Malayan and Javanese as languages of instruction. By using these languages, pesantren became ""a 
transit"" for Middle Eastern Islamic thinking to be understood and practiced by the general public in 
Southeast Asia; Secondly, a dialectic process between religious thinking and rational thinking of the

6 As a note, most of Madrasah at this time is a privately held, and is organized by pesantren to accommodate more public 
education, in addition to Islamic Religious Education.

Western world occurred by means of debate and discussion or muzakarah (discussion) and muhadharah 
(speech), and between teachers and students, which resulted in various works; Thirdly, by way of 
intellectual network of santris that stretched out across Southeast Asia, a blueprint for Islamic 
civilization was produced, which later on was practiced by kingdoms and sultanates across Southeast 
Asia. 

 
However, the excellence of these roles has grown dim.10 One of the reasons for this is that by ways of 
scientific dialectic, a battle paradigms on the study of Islam also took place between East and West Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 
which on one side has improved the dialectic of Islamic scientific development. However, unfortunately 
this was not followed by improved tradition in writing among the santris, thus making it difficult to find 
such excellent works like those written by the earliest architect of pesantren. The Syarah and hasyiyah 
traditions are not too popular among the new generation of Muslims today.11  
 
On the other hand, Islamic Education as a development product of pesantrens has been growing rapidly 
and has become part of the National Education System contributing to delivering education to 20% of 
the total students in Indonesia. The Islamic education system in Indonesia, which is supported by 
approximately 75 thousand madrasahs, 14 thousand pesantrens, 676 higher education institutions, has 
become the largest system in Southeast Asia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and possibly the world. The Indonesian Islamic Education 
system has 1,457 study programs at the higher education level, including 82 study programs for Masters 
and Doctoral level, and has also become the place to grow and to produce studies on Islamic education. 
Moreover, with the support of about 12,367 lecturers, including 1,259 doctoral degrees, and also 415 
professors12, , Islamic universities in Indonesia have great potential to be a facility for varied and high 
quality Islamic studies. Given the support of the ""5,000 Doctoral Programs"", which was launched by the 
Director General of Islamic Education in 2014, the strength of intellectual human resources in Islamic 
Education in Indonesia would be enormous. 
 
By having this modality, now is the time for the Ã¢â‚¬Å“revival of IslamÃ¢â‚¬Â in Indonesia - which was once 
achieved in the past by the role of pesantrens. Such revival needs to be relived under the new banner of 
""the revival of Islamic Education"". For this reason, the Directorate General of Islamic Education declared 
that the vision of Islamic Education in the Islamic Education Strategic Plan (Renstra) 2015-2019 is: 

 
Realizing Excellent and Moderate Islamic Education in Indonesia that serves as a World Reference in 

Integrating Religious Study, Science and Technology

Topic	#16	 Ensuring	Gender	Equity	in	Education	

	
The	commitment	to	gender	equality	in	education	
	
Since	 the	 last	 decade,	 Indonesia	 has	 been	 improving	 gender	 equity	 in	 education.	 Committing	 to	 the	 Millennium	
Development	Goals	(MDGs),	and	now	Sustainable	Development	Goals	(SDGs),	Indonesia	is	taking	further	steps	to	provide	
equal	access	for	boys	and	girls	as	well	as	improving	their	learning	achievements	and	outcomes.	The	MDGs	reaffirmed	that	
universal	primary	completion	and	gender	equity	 in	both	primary	and	secondary	education	should	be	achieved	by	2015.	
The	SDGs	have	included	gender	equity	not	only	in	primary	and	secondary	education,	but	also	early	childhood,	technical	
and	vocational	as	well	as	higher	education.		
	
Gender	parity	has	now	been	 largely	achieved	at	all	 levels	of	 the	education	 system	and	 in	 literacy	 rates	 for	 IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	
youth	(15-24	age	group).	These	successes	have	come	from	a	combination	of	effective	policies	and	national	investments	in	
education	that	have	expanded	school	availability	in	rural	areas	and	have	lowered	costs	of	schooling.	
	
Achieving	 gender	parity	 in	 access	 alone	 is	 only	 the	 first	 step;	 this	 does	 not	 equate	 to	 equality	 in	 education	outcomes	
which	requires	equal	opportunity	for	learning	for	both	females	and	males	which,	 in	turn,	 implies	that	both	females	and	
males	are	to	be	treated	equally	and	fairly	by	teachers.	It	also	includes	gender	sensitivity	in	the	curriculum,	textbooks	and	
learning	materials	as	well	as	in	the	learning	environment	in	general..	Taking	it	further,	gender	equality	in	education	would	
contribute	 a	 necessary	 --	 but	 not	 sufficient	 --	 condition	 to	 realizing	 equal	 opportunities	 in	 the	 labor	market	 and	other	
spheres	of	life.	
	
Challenges	
	
While	there	is	general	support	for	gender	issues	at	the	central	level,	there	is	a	lack	of	clear	strategic	direction	for	gender	
mainstreaming	 in	 education	 and	 limited	 specialist	 technical	 capacity	 in	 Indonesia	 on	 this	 topic.	 Government	 staff	 still	
needs	to	improve	their	sensitivity	in	this	area,	particularly	because	many	of	the	pioneers	in	this	field	have	now	retired	and	
gender	equality	skills	and	knowledge	have	not	been	sufficiently	regenerated.		
	
The	ways	that	girls	and	boys	experience	teaching	and	learning	in	the	classroom	can	be	quite	different,	 influencing	their	
class	 participation,	 educational	 achievement	 and	 learning	 outcomes.	 Social	 and	 cultural	 values	 and	 stereotypes	 about	
gender	can	be	inadvertently	reinforced	in	the	classroom	and	at	school	through	teacher-pupil	and	pupil-pupil	interaction.	
The	teaching	approaches	and	pedagogy	and	the	ways	to	engage	and	assess	students,	may	also	often	inadvertently	favor	
boys.	In	Indonesia,	training	teachers	to	treat	females	and	males	equally	through	sharing	all	tasks	and	participating	in	all	
school	 activities	 is	 often	 overlooked.	 To	 date,	 provincial	 education	 quality	 assurance	 institutes,	 teacher	 training	
institutions	 and	 local	 teacher	 professional	 development	 networks	 in	 Indonesia	 have	 not	 been	 gender	 sensitized	 or	
mainstreamed.	
	
The	 role	 of	 the	 curriculum	 is	 critical	 to	 ensuring	 that	 boys	 and	 girls	 are	 given	 equal	 opportunities	 for	 success	 and	
advancement	in	schools.	In	Indonesia,	recent	research	on	curriculum	and	textbooks	from	PAUD	to	senior	secondary	levels

-	in	both	general	and	Islamic	schools	--	indicates	portrayal	of	gender	roles	consistent	with	traditional	social	norms,	which	
often	 accept	 male	 superiority	 and	 authority.	 There	 is	 also	 a	 lack	 of	 access	 to	 Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhigh-interestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 reading	 books	 in	 school	
libraries	that	appeal	to	the	different	interests	of	boys	and	girls	in	a	number	of	schools	visited.	
	
During	 informal	 interviews	 conducted	on	 teachersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	perceptions	 (both	male	and	 female)	 in	 junior	and	 senior	 secondary	
schools,	 an	ACDP	 research	 study	has	also	 revealed	 that	 teachers	unanimously	held	 the	belief	 that	boys	were	better	at	
science	 and	 girls	were	 better	 at	 Bahasa	 Indonesia	 and	 English.	 These	 perceptions	mirror	 results	 from	performance	 on	
international	assessments	carried	out	in	Indonesia	in	these	subjects.	However,	significantly,	there	was	no	reported	gender	
insensitivity	regarding	mathematics	or	any	significant	gender	difference	in	mathematics	assessments.	In	choosing	subject	
specialisms	at	 senior	 secondary	 level	and	beyond,	career	counselors	do	not	encourage	 females	 to	choose	subjects	and	
follow	career	paths	which	are	traditionally	perceived	as	occupying	the	male	domain.	
	
Efforts	required	to	improve	gender	mainstreaming	in	education	
	
Availability	of	gender	expertise	within	the	government	staff	is	critical	for	implementing	and	maintaining	gender	equality	
in	education.	 It	will	be	strategic	 to	have	trained	male	and	female	team	members	 (Ã¢â‚¬Å“wearing	the	gender	hatÃ¢â‚¬Â)	 to	ensure	
that	all	activities	throughout	the	education	system	are	gender	sensitive	and,	in	areas	where	resistance	to	gender	equality	
promotion	is	high,	to	conduct	effective	gender-responsive	capacity	development	activities.	
	
Teachers	 can	 be	 critical	 key	 change	 agents	 for	 gender	 equality	 by	 encouraging	 boys	 and	 girls	 to	 undertake	 certain	
activities,	providing	a	sense	of	direction	and	acting	as	role	models	themselves.	Best	practice	in	integrating	gender	equality	
into	teaching	and	learning	practices	includes	challenging	stereotypes,	including	attitudes	towards	girls	and	boys	aptitudes,	
giving	equal	attention	to	boys	and	girls	and	encouraging	girls	to	take	part	 in	extramural	activities	normally	reserved	for	
boys.	 Also,	 a	 comprehensive	 pre-service	 teacher	 training	 programme	 and	 in-service	 school	 supervisor,	 principal	 and	
teacher	training	programmes	must	be	instituted	to	focus	on	skills	for	improved	gender	responsive	approach.	
	
Plans	for	reviewing	the	curricula	must	ensure	that	the	curricula	contain	no	gender	bias	or	gender	stereotyping.	Regular	
revision	of	curriculum	and	teaching	materials	must	include	gender-sensitive	approaches	and	gender	perspectives	and	the	
establishment	 of	 specific	 bodies	 that	 are	 tasked	 with	 the	 elimination	 of	 gender	 stereotypes	 in	 textbooks	 and	 other	
teaching	materials.	
	
Equality	of	external	results	is	achieved	when	the	status	of	men	and	women;	their	access	to	goods	and	resources;	and	their	
ability	to	contribute	to,	participate	in,	and	benefit	from	economic,	social,	cultural	and	political	activities	are	all	equal.	This	
dimension	of	equality	falls	outside	the	education	system,	but	the	achievement	of	equality	in	education	acts	as	a	catalyst	
and	 contributes	 to	 equality	 for	 males	 and	 females	 in	 other	 spheres	 of	 life,	 including	 the	 labor	 market	 and	 domestic	
spheres.

The	 Ã‚Â Philosophy	 Ã‚Â behind	 Ã‚Â Local	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â Index	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
As	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â public	 Ã‚Â becomes	 Ã‚Â  increasingly	 Ã‚Â aware	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  importance	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  government	 Ã‚Â  transparency,	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â necessary	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â 
make	 Ã‚Â  information	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  status	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  accessible.	 Ã‚Â  Such	 Ã‚Â  information	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  only	 Ã‚Â  useful	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
government	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  planning	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  formulating	 Ã‚Â  policies,	 Ã‚Â  but	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  can	 Ã‚Â  also	 Ã‚Â  increase	 Ã‚Â  public	 Ã‚Â  participation	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  order	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â 
improve	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â Ministry	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Culture	 Ã‚Â (MoEC)	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â recognized	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â improving	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â requires	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â participation	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â full	 Ã‚Â contribution	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â  stakeholders	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â solving	 Ã‚Â various	 Ã‚Â 
issues	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  education.	 Ã‚Â  Therefore,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Local	 Ã‚Â  Education	 Ã‚Â  Index	 Ã‚Â  (Neraca	 Ã‚Â  Pendidikan	 Ã‚Â  Daerah	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  NPD)	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â 
prepared	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â MoEC	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â present	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â picture	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â local	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â provincial	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â regency/city	 Ã‚Â (kabupaten/kota)	 Ã‚Â 
levels.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
NPD	 Ã‚Â  serves	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  'magnifying	 Ã‚Â  glass'	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  examining	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  current	 Ã‚Â  state	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  form	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â 
disclosure	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  public.	 Ã‚Â  NPD	 Ã‚Â  presents	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  profile	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  system	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  terms	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  access,	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â 
management	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â 34	 Ã‚Â provinces	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 514	 Ã‚Â regencies/cities	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Indonesia.	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â invaluable	 Ã‚Â asset	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â policy	 Ã‚Â  formulation	 Ã‚Â process	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  further	 Ã‚Â development	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  sector.	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â expected	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â help	 Ã‚Â create	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â 
dynamic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â ecosystem	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â active	 Ã‚Â interaction	 Ã‚Â between	 Ã‚Â actors	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â sector.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Decision-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âmakers	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  stakeholders	 Ã‚Â  at	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  national	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  regional	 Ã‚Â  levels	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  expected	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  use	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  information	 Ã‚Â 
presented	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â reference	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â setting	 Ã‚Â priorities	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â development.	 Ã‚Â Additionally,	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â 
be	 Ã‚Â used	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â create	 Ã‚Â accountability	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â transparency	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â allocation	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â managment	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â 
from	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  State	 Ã‚Â  Budget	 Ã‚Â  (Anggaran	 Ã‚Â  Pendapatan	 Ã‚Â  dan	 Ã‚Â  Belanja	 Ã‚Â  Negara	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  APBN)	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Regional	 Ã‚Â  Budget	 Ã‚Â 
(Anggaran	 Ã‚Â  Pendapatan	 Ã‚Â  dan	 Ã‚Â  Belanja	 Ã‚Â  Daerah	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  APBD),	 Ã‚Â  which	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  done	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â  Education	 Ã‚Â  Office	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
province	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â kabupaten/kota.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
NPD	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  being	 Ã‚Â made	 Ã‚Â  accessible	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â wider	 Ã‚Â  audience	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  increase	 Ã‚Â  public	 Ã‚Â  participation	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  order	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  improve	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â Having	 Ã‚Â access	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â  information	 Ã‚Â presented	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â expected	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â allow	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â public	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
other	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â stakeholders	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â increase	 Ã‚Â their	 Ã‚Â awareness,	 Ã‚Â concern	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â participation	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â management	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
improvement	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â

Information	 Ã‚Â Presented	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Local	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â Index	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
NPD	 Ã‚Â  presents	 Ã‚Â  brief	 Ã‚Â  information	 Ã‚Â  about	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  state	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â  education.	 Ã‚Â  Information	 Ã‚Â  presented	 Ã‚Â  includes	 Ã‚Â  general	 Ã‚Â 
information	 Ã‚Â such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â information	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â budget,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â educational	 Ã‚Â units	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
students	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  teachers.	 Ã‚Â  NPD	 Ã‚Â  also	 Ã‚Â  includes	 Ã‚Â  information	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  educational	 Ã‚Â  attainment	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  National	 Ã‚Â  Exam	 Ã‚Â 
results,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Integrity	 Ã‚Â  Index	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  accompanies	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  National	 Ã‚Â  Exam,	 Ã‚Â  Teacher	 Ã‚Â  Competency	 Ã‚Â  Test	 Ã‚Â  results	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â 
Accreditation.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Information	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â presented	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â straightforward	 Ã‚Â way	 Ã‚Â so	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â it	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â easily	 Ã‚Â understood	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â decision-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â
makers/stakeholders	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â public.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â Local	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â Index	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â includes	 Ã‚Â information	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â literacy	 Ã‚Â rates	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â Human	 Ã‚Â Development	 Ã‚Â Index	 Ã‚Â (HDI).	 Ã‚Â

One	 Ã‚Â  input	 Ã‚Â  indicator	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â major	 Ã‚Â concern	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“education	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â  indicatorÃ¢â‚¬Â.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â 
indicator	 Ã‚Â used	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â calculated	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â considering	 Ã‚Â only	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â allocated	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â 
sector.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â allocated	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â sector	 Ã‚Â does	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â include	 Ã‚Â funds	 Ã‚Â given	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â activities	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â programmes	 Ã‚Â 
that	 Ã‚Â relate	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â but	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â  located	 Ã‚Â outside	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â sector,	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â example	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â School	 Ã‚Â Health	 Ã‚Â Unit	 Ã‚Â 
(Unit	 Ã‚Â Kesehatan	 Ã‚Â Sekolah)	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â under	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â health	 Ã‚Â sector	 Ã‚Â but	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â located	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â relates	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  budget	 Ã‚Â  indicator	 Ã‚Â  allows	 Ã‚Â  one	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  distinguish	 Ã‚Â  between	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  two	 Ã‚Â  sources	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  funding	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
education	 Ã‚Â  budget:	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  State	 Ã‚Â  Budget	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Regional	 Ã‚Â  Budget.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â  indicator	 Ã‚Â  enables	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â  assessment	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  how	 Ã‚Â 
much	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â local	 Ã‚Â government	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â committed	 Ã‚Â itself	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â sector.	 Ã‚Â Thus,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â indicator	 Ã‚Â opens	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â door	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â 
further	 Ã‚Â analysis	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â research	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â links	 Ã‚Â data	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â financial	 Ã‚Â commitment	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â local	 Ã‚Â level	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â attainment,	 Ã‚Â 
as	 Ã‚Â revealed	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â achievement	 Ã‚Â indicators.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â  data	 Ã‚Â  used	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  presented	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  NPD	 Ã‚Â were	 Ã‚Â  taken	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  various	 Ã‚Â  sources.	 Ã‚Â Most	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  data	 Ã‚Â were	 Ã‚Â  taken	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â 
MoEC	 Ã‚Â agencies,	 Ã‚Â including	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Center	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Data	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Statistics	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Culture	 Ã‚Â (Pusat	 Ã‚Â Data	 Ã‚Â dan	 Ã‚Â Statistik	 Ã‚Â

or	 Ã‚Â BAN-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬ÂSM).	 Ã‚Â Other	 Ã‚Â data	 Ã‚Â were	 Ã‚Â taken	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â external	 Ã‚Â sources	 Ã‚Â including	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Central	 Ã‚Â Bureau	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Statistics	 Ã‚Â (Biro	 Ã‚Â Pusat	 Ã‚Â 
Statistik	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  BPS),	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Ministry	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Home	 Ã‚Â  Affairs	 Ã‚Â  (Kementerian	 Ã‚Â  Dalam	 Ã‚Â  Negeri	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  MoHA)	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Ministry	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â 
Finance	 Ã‚Â (Kementerian	 Ã‚Â Keuangan	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â MoF).	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â data	 Ã‚Â used	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â calculating	 Ã‚Â each	 Ã‚Â indicator	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â confirmed	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â 
relevant	 Ã‚Â units	 Ã‚Â before	 Ã‚Â being	 Ã‚Â published	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â NPD.	 Ã‚Â However,	 Ã‚Â some	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â still	 Ã‚Â being	 Ã‚Â verified	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â validated	 Ã‚Â because	 Ã‚Â 
such	 Ã‚Â data	 Ã‚Â continuously	 Ã‚Â change.	 Ã‚Â

	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â  Ministry	 Ã‚Â  plans	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  publish	 Ã‚Â  NPD	 Ã‚Â  every	 Ã‚Â  year	 Ã‚Â  so	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  can	 Ã‚Â  provide	 Ã‚Â  information	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  current	 Ã‚Â  status	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â 
education	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia.	 Ã‚Â  NPD	 Ã‚Â  2015	 Ã‚Â  was	 Ã‚Â  officially	 Ã‚Â  launched	 Ã‚Â  at	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  National	 Ã‚Â  Conference	 Ã‚Â  (Rembugnas)	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â 
Education	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Culture	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â February	 Ã‚Â 2015.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â data	 Ã‚Â presented	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â 2015	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â most	 Ã‚Â recent	 Ã‚Â data	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â almost	 Ã‚Â 
all	 Ã‚Â indicators	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â 2015	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â calculated	 Ã‚Â using	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â data	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â year	 Ã‚Â 2015.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Presently,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  NPD	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  disseminated	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  public,	 Ã‚Â  local	 Ã‚Â  governments	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  stakeholders	 Ã‚Â 
through	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â variety	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â events	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â activities	 Ã‚Â including	 Ã‚Â exhibitions	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â visits	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â ministerial	 Ã‚Â guests.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â 
been	 Ã‚Â publicized	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â various	 Ã‚Â media.	 Ã‚Â To	 Ã‚Â provide	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â access,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â digital	 Ã‚Â version	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â downloaded	 Ã‚Â 
from	 Ã‚Â www.npd.data.kemdikbud.go.id	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â Android	 Ã‚Â application	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Google	 Ã‚Â Play	 Ã‚Â Store.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â 
will	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â improved	 Ã‚Â continuously	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â terms	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â its	 Ã‚Â layout	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â indicators.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â digital	 Ã‚Â version	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â improved	 Ã‚Â so	 Ã‚Â 
that	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â used	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â achieve	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â stated	 Ã‚Â objectives.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â NPD	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â expected	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â allow	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â public	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â access	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â use	 Ã‚Â  information	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â easily,	 Ã‚Â  thereby	 Ã‚Â  increasing	 Ã‚Â their	 Ã‚Â 
active	 Ã‚Â  involvement	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â  regional	 Ã‚Â  governments	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  developing	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia.	 Ã‚Â  Moreover,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  wider	 Ã‚Â 
community	 Ã‚Â  can	 Ã‚Â  use	 Ã‚Â  NPD	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  fully	 Ã‚Â  contribute	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  providing	 Ã‚Â  solutions	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  problems	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  order	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  bring	 Ã‚Â 
quality,	 Ã‚Â affordable	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â equitable	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â Indonesian	 Ã‚Â people.	 Ã‚Â

Topik #18 Local Investment on Education and Its Impact on Education Quality and Access  

 
Regional Education Budget as Investment  
 
Since the early 2000s, Indonesia has made progress in implementing the education reform agenda and 
significantly increasing spending on education. Since 2009, government spending on education has continued 
to grow exponentially. Education reform and the increase in government spending has resulted in improved 
access, especially for the poor, as well as improved educational attainment. However, the effectiveness and 
efficiency of government spending in the education sector can still be improved. 
 
Weak mechanisms for allocating resources from the central to the local governments and schools have 
reduced the impact that an increase in government spending could have had on education attainment. The 
system regulating the flow of financial resources to schools might be a major source of inefficiency and limit 
the education system's ability to provide good quality education. Several studies have highlighted the 
expenditure inefficiency arising from the system set up to govern the flow of government financial resources in 
the education sector. 
 
NPD aims at providing a 'magnifying glass' for analysing the status of local education, which is invaluable for 
supporting policy formulation and further development of the education sector. NPD uses an indicator to 
measure local education budgets, which is an input indicator and of primary interest in the Local Education 
Index (Neraca Pendidikan Daerah / NPD). 
 
There are two sources of funding used to finance the education system in Indonesia.  These include the 
Regional Budget (Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Daerah/APBD) and the National Budget (Anggaran 
Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara/APBN). In general, local governments allocate 20% or more of their budgets 
to education. The largest proportion of the education budget comes from the National Budget through a cash 
transfer. 
 
The budget indicator used by NPD shows the size of investment in local education and supports a more 
thorough analysis of the relationship between local education budgets and improvements in education quality 
and access as measured by indicators of education attainment. For example, the province of West Java has 
allocated 1.69% (Rp. 417.5 billion) of its total budget (Rp. 24.7 trillion) to education. The amount is equivalent 
to Rp. 44,800 per student per year. This is a relatively low amount of local government spending on education, 
and it might explain why the average results of West JavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s National Exam are below the national average for 
all education levels. Another analysis made using NPD shows that, in general, the size of the education budget 
has a weak correlation with Teacher Competency Test results (Uji Kompetensi Guru/UKG). Some regions with 
small budgets have high UKG scores, and vice versa. For instance, West Java invests Rp. 44,800 per student per 
year, and have UKG scores averaging 58.97, which is above the national average of 56.69. 
  
Allocating More Targeted and Efficient Investment  
 
Improving existing financing mechanisms would greatly improve budget efficiency. Several countries that are 
facing the same challenges as Indonesia have reformed financing mechanisms and improved the efficiency of 
overall government spending. These countries introduced a funding formula based on the needs of education

development. Developing appropriate financing mechanisms will be an important component of efforts to 
improve the quality of education while reducing disparities. 
 
The information presented in NPD could be used to determine a funding formula for Indonesia as well as 
priorities for education investment. Regencies and cities with low scores on several NPD indicators should align 
their resources to address any indicated problems. The current Minister of Education and Culture 
commissioned PASKA to use NPD to identify and list regencies and cities with low scores and designate them 
as pilot regions. Approximately 100 to 150 regencies and cities are to be established as pilot regions. Together 
with the Ministry of Education and Culture, the local governments of these pilot regencies and cities are 
expected to target more investment in education, especially where there is low performance. The NPD allows 
the Ministry of Education and Culture to immediately address issues without needing to wait for reports and 
requests for education development from the regions or schools. 
 
For example, it is known that West Java needs a stronger effort to overcome illiteracy especially in some 
regencies. To do so, education programs and spending will need to focus on improving teacher competence to 
improve the quality of student learning. In addition, many school-age children are not enrolled at any type of 
educational institutions and this will also need to be addressed. Thus, the focus of education development and 
spending should be directed to finding solutions to these problems as indicated by NPD. 
 
Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government spending in the local education sector is essential if 
commitments to improving education are to be realized. NPD provides the necessary information for 
measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of education budget. NPD will also be important in assessing how 
existing and additional resources can be allocated to regions and issues that need more support. A well made 
plan can ensure appropriate resource allocation to the regions, programs and activities that require immediate 
attention.

Topic #19 Principals: Management, Authority and Role in Determining School Quality 

 
Effective School Principals 

Exemplary school principals are considered an important factor in improving school effectiveness and 
enhancing education quality. Highly effective school principals are shown to continually lead the redesign of 
their schools, provide effective professional development, engage in regular evaluation and school 
improvement processes and rethink goals, priorities, finances, curriculum and pedagogies.  

In decentralized education systems, the role of the principal becomes especially important. IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 
Ministerial Regulation 44/2002 mandated school-based management and placed educational management 
firmly in the school, making the principal the key decision maker. Principals have been given a role in school 
finance and budgeting, staff management, school planning and curriculum development. Thus, principals need 
upgraded skills, training and knowledge in effectively managing schools and resources.   

Currently there is room for improvement. Principals are shown to be implementing administrative 
requirements and education policy routinely, but without the skill and knowledge of instructional leaders.  This 
is in line with Michael FullanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent presentation on maximizing the impact of principals. As Fullan points out: 

 

Ã¢â‚¬Å“There has never been a time when the circumstances for the role of principal have been more 
volatile. Facing the unpredictable, principals must be able to handle a good deal of ambiguity while 
displaying strong lead learner qualities.Ã¢â‚¬Â 

 

Professional development for principals is also often inadequate, consisting of little more than a briefing on 
policy documents. PrincipalsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ managerial and academic supervision competencies were revealed to be low 
compared to the other competencies. In addition, decentralization may have started a system by which 
principals are being less appointed by formal merit and experience than favoritism and manipulation. 

IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) has recognized the importance of developing exemplary 
principals.  Ministerial Regulation 28/2010 was passed to establish the legal basis for principal preparation, 
principal licensing, recruitment and appointment and performance appraisal. Continuing Professional 
Development (CPD) programs have also been introduced for teachers and include the teachers eligible to be 
school principals. 

Principal Preparation Programs (PPP) 

PPPs are conducted to prepare those eligible to be principals. International evidence on PPP has provided 
insight into indicators of successful programs.  Such programs are thought to have an explicit purpose, 
coherence between content and goals, the right balance of theory and practice, appropriate admissions 
criteria, a focus on continuing assessment and is subject to regular evaluation including feedback from 
participants, trainers and policy makers.

PPP in Indonesia is offered by LPPKS and involves three stages of learning: 70 hours of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœin-service learning 
which is conducted face-to-face, 200 hours of on-the-job learning which occurs over three months and 
requires participants to undertake a school based research project and 30 hours of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœin-serviceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ face-to-face 
learning and assessment. Teachers who successfully complete professional learning are awarded a Nomor Unik 
Kepala Sekolah (NUKS).  

In 2014, ACDP completed an evaluation of IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s PPP based on the assumption that the quality and 
competence of future principals is dependent on the effectiveness of PPP. The study attempted to measure 
the effectiveness, relevance, efficiency and impact of the national PPP to identify in what contexts it has 
worked and why in order to support LPPKS.  

Overall, the evaluation revealed that PPP is considered to be very effective and relevant to the participants 
who have taken part in the program. The program is considered capable of improving the competencies of 
principals and the quality and relevance of the training provided are considered to be high.  

However, the degree of political and bureaucratic involvement in identifying applicants into PPP and in the 
appointment of school principals was thought to be problematic. In addition, many of the evaluationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 
respondents admitted that LPPKS could review and strengthen training modules related to pedagogy skills, 
active learning and ICT use in learning as well as administrative instruction.  According to Yaya Kardiawarman, 
Manager of Education Quality untuk proyek School, System and Quality (SSQ), yang didanai oleh pemerintah 
Australia, PPP in Indonesia requires a paradigm shift from one that emphasises Ã¢â‚¬Å“learning to knowÃ¢â‚¬Â to one that 
emphasizes Ã¢â‚¬Å“learning to doÃ¢â‚¬Â.   

Two aspects of PPP that were considered particularly effective by the evaluation were NUKS and the PPP 
mentoring program. Maximising the effectiveness of these two aspects will involve overcoming a few 
challenges, as noted below.  

NUKS 

NUKS is one aspect of IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s PPP that ACPDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evaluation found especially effective. NUKS indicates that a 
teacher is eligible to be appointed as a school principal, and participants considered NUKS to be very 
prestigious and to have clear standards. 

However, based on data from LPPKS, only between 1.2% and 2.1% of all principals had a NUKS in 2014/2015.  
Although regulation 28 provides guidelines and directions for principal appointment, including ensuring that 
appointed principals have a NUK, only 35% of all graduates from PPP who have a NUKS have been appointed 
to be principals. This suggests there is not yet full compliance to Ministerial regulations at the district level. 
One suggestion has been to ensure all principals hold a NUKS by 2030, but many people think this is too 
ambitious. Such initiative would require about 14,000 aspiring principals to successfully complete the PPP and 
receive a NUKS each year from 2016-2030. This would require the training of an additional 117 Master trainers 
per year, and an additional 660 Assessors each year. 

Mentoring and Continuous Professional Development (CPD) 

Evaluations of principal training done in Australia, Europe and the USA have highlighted the importance of 
transitional supports for principals such as CPD, coaching and mentoring programs. These are often required 
to ensure that newly accredited principals succeed and stay on the job. CPD for principals in Indonesia consists 
of three levels: CPD 1 is for beginner principals and aims to improve competency and performance of 
principals at their work place. CPD 2 is for more experienced principals and aims to improve the leadership and 
performance of principals.  Finally, CPD 3 is for expert principals and aims to give them more expertise in 
specific areas such as developing national curriculum or conducting research on class activities.  



 

 

3

The ACDP evaluation revealed one strength of IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s PPP program to be the mentoring program that has 
been implemented to support PPP participants during the on the job learning component of training.  

The mentoring program in Indonesia is conducted in part by Master Trainers, who are trained, accredited and 
employed by LPPKS. In addition to conducting part of the training provided in PPP, Master Trainers provide 
mentoring support to participants during on the job learning.  Almost all of the evaluationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ respondents 
considered the quality and effectiveness of the Master Trainers to be either Ã¢â‚¬ËœgoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬Ëœvery goodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.  

However, there is still need for improvement. For example, many respondents claimed that Master Trainers 
did not always attend training sessions, and, when they did attend, they were often more focused on 
messages related to their full-time jobs than focused on their work as Master Trainers. In addition, the quality 
of mentoring was reported to vary, and some respondents indicated that the mentoring they received was 
only via email, text message or phone call.  The study suggests that LPPKS be more assiduous about the 
attendance and performance of Master Trainers. LPPKS could also run Ã¢â‚¬Ëœrefresher programs for Master Trainers, 
and these programs should be required for their re-certification.

Indonesia	 Ã‚Â  faces	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â considerable	 Ã‚Â challenge	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â providing	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â workforce	 Ã‚Â able	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â deliver	 Ã‚Â high-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â
quality	 Ã‚Â  teaching	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  every	 Ã‚Â  student	 Ã‚Â  across	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  country.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â  government	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  taking	 Ã‚Â  this	 Ã‚Â  challenge	 Ã‚Â 
seriously	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â introduced	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â key	 Ã‚Â policies	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â raise	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â status	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â teachers.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â 
most	 Ã‚Â  significant	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  these	 Ã‚Â  policies	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Law	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  Teachers	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  Lecturers	 Ã‚Â  (Law	 Ã‚Â  No.14	 Ã‚Â  2005),	 Ã‚Â  which	 Ã‚Â 
confirmed	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â profession.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â Law	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â Teachers	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Lecturers	 Ã‚Â requires	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â hold	 Ã‚Â 
an	 Ã‚Â academic	 Ã‚Â bachelorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â degree	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â successfully	 Ã‚Â achieve	 Ã‚Â certification.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â professional	 Ã‚Â allowances	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â accompany	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â certification	 Ã‚Â process	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â led	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â pay	 Ã‚Â increases,	 Ã‚Â 
which	 Ã‚Â  effectively	 Ã‚Â  double	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  income	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  certified	 Ã‚Â  teachers.	 Ã‚Â  This	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  aligned	 Ã‚Â  teachersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â  status	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â 
other	 Ã‚Â  professions	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  law	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â medicine	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  provided	 Ã‚Â  effective	 Ã‚Â  incentives	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â 
upgrade	 Ã‚Â  their	 Ã‚Â  qualifications.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â  perception	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  teaching	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  career	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  improving	 Ã‚Â  rapidly	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â 
more	 Ã‚Â  students	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  now	 Ã‚Â  attracted	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  enter	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  profession	 Ã‚Â  because	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  these	 Ã‚Â  policies.	 Ã‚Â  However,	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â 
number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â inefficiencies	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â arisen	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â this	 Ã‚Â reform.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
ÃƒËœÃ¯Æ’Ëœ Indonesia	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  374	 Ã‚Â  teacher	 Ã‚Â  training	 Ã‚Â  institutes,	 Ã‚Â  32	 Ã‚Â  public	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  342	 Ã‚Â  private.	 Ã‚Â  They	 Ã‚Â  operate	 Ã‚Â  largely	 Ã‚Â

In	 Ã‚Â  terms	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  financing	 Ã‚Â  system	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â distribution	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  teachers,	 Ã‚Â  significant	 Ã‚Â problems	 Ã‚Â arise	 Ã‚Â when	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
trend	 Ã‚Â over	 Ã‚Â time	 Ã‚Â suggests	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â growing	 Ã‚Â faster	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â pupils,	 Ã‚Â 
particularly	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  primary	 Ã‚Â  schools.	 Ã‚Â  In	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  past	 Ã‚Â  only	 Ã‚Â  students	 Ã‚Â  who	 Ã‚Â  had	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  refused	 Ã‚Â  entry	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  other	 Ã‚Â 
professions	 Ã‚Â  would	 Ã‚Â  enter	 Ã‚Â  teaching.	 Ã‚Â  IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â  new	 Ã‚Â  certification	 Ã‚Â  system	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  accompanying	 Ã‚Â 
professional	 Ã‚Â allowances	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â successful	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â now	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â attractive	 Ã‚Â career	 Ã‚Â choice	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â  result	 Ã‚Â  there	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â  steady	 Ã‚Â  increase	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â qualified	 Ã‚Â  students	 Ã‚Â entering	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  teaching	 Ã‚Â 
profession.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â However,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â certification	 Ã‚Â system	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â created	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â number	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â inefficiencies,	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â 
now	 Ã‚Â need	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â urgently	 Ã‚Â addressed.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Getting	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â right	 Ã‚Â people	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â become	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â developing	 Ã‚Â them	 Ã‚Â into	 Ã‚Â effective	 Ã‚Â instructors	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â two	 Ã‚Â 
of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â key	 Ã‚Â characteristics	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â differentiate	 Ã‚Â high-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â low-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âperforming	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â systems	 Ã‚Â (Barber	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
Mourshed,	 Ã‚Â  2007).	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â  top-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âperforming	 Ã‚Â  teacher	 Ã‚Â  training	 Ã‚Â  colleges	 Ã‚Â  systems	 Ã‚Â  consistently	 Ã‚Â  attract	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â 
able	 Ã‚Â people	 Ã‚Â into	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â profession.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Speaking	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  upstream	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  downstream,	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  important	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â mention	 Ã‚Â  about	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  teacher	 Ã‚Â 
candidates	 Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€œstudents	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â prospective	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â majoring	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â educationÃ¢â‚¬â€œ	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â 
training	 Ã‚Â institutions	 Ã‚Â (lembaga-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âlembaga	 Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬ËœpencetakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â tenaga	 Ã‚Â pendidik).	 Ã‚Â This	 Ã‚Â issue	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â without	 Ã‚Â reason,	 Ã‚Â 
because	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â become	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â main	 Ã‚Â pillar	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â educational	 Ã‚Â success.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â precondition	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â high-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âquality	 Ã‚Â 
teaching	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â high-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âquality	 Ã‚Â teachers.	 Ã‚Â Reviewing	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â capacity	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â training	 Ã‚Â colleges:	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
1. Are	 Ã‚Â  individuals	 Ã‚Â  who	 Ã‚Â  enroll	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  become	 Ã‚Â  college	 Ã‚Â  students	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  future	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  qualified	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â

Topic	#20	 Indonesia	National	Qualification	Framework:	Defining	Indonesia	Competitiveness	

	
National	Qualifications	Framework	
	
In	todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	global	economy	with	the	rapidly	increasing	free	movement	of	goods,	services,	capital,	technology	and	skills,	
many	countries	are	looking	to	implement	qualifications	frameworks	to	increase	the	global	mobility	of	workers.	
	
Qualifications	 frameworks	 set	 standards	 and	 criteria	 for	 a	 nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 agreed	 qualifications	 while	 also	 serving	 as	
mechanisms	 to	 allow	 skills	 and	qualifications	 gained	elsewhere	 to	be	 recognized.	 The	 standards	 and	 criteria	which	
comprise	 qualifications	 frameworks	 are	 based	 on	 learning	 outcomes,	 which	 are	 expressed	 as	 what	 a	 graduate	 or	
qualification	 holder	 knows,	 can	 do,	 and	 can	 apply	 in	 contexts	 such	 as	 the	 workplace	 or	 further	 learning.	 Basing	
qualifications	 on	 learning	 outcomes	 has	 placed	 new	 emphasis	 on	 assessment	 and	 has	 allowed	 people	 to	 achieve	
qualifications	through	different	pathways	which	may	not	all	be	based	on	formal	learning.	
	
The	Indonesian	Qualification	Framework	(IQF)	was	established	to	respond	to	national	needs	and	regional	and	global	
trends	 of	 economic	 integration.	 	 Presidential	 Regulation	 8/2012	 on	 the	 IQF	was	 enacted	 in	 2012	 and	 stipulated	 a	
hierarchy	of	9	qualification	levels	to	allow	comparison	of	the	outcomes	of	formal,	non-formal	and	informal	education	
as	well	as	work	experience.	The	three	main	players	in	developing	IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	qualification	framework	are	the	Ministry	
of	Education	and	Culture	(MoEC),	Ministry	of	Manpower	(MoM)	and	the	Ministry	of	Research,	Technology	and	Higher	
Education	(MoRTHE).		The	current	stage	of	implementation	of	IQF	varies	among	different	sectors	in	Indonesia.		While	
certification	is	common	in	vocational	stream	such	as	polytechnics,	implementing	learning	outcome	is	relatively	new	in	
higher	education.	
	
In	 2014,	 the	 ACDP	 commissioned	 a	 study	 team	 to	 support	 the	 development	 of	 the	 IQF	 through	 a	 study	 on	
international	experiences,	a	study	of	the	development	of	IQF	in	key	fields	in	Indonesia,	the	analysis	of	finding	as	well	
as	 recommendations.	 	The	study	also	covers	 the	 road	map	 for	 the	 implementation	of	 the	 IQF,	 the	development	of	
Recognition	of	Prior	Learning	(RPL)	and	the	establishment	of	the	Indonesian	Qualifications	Board.	
	
IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	National	Needs	for	a	Qualifications	Framework	
	
Nationally,	Indonesia	faces	manpower	challenges	including	a	mismatch	between	professional	and	skills	education	and	
training	outcomes	and	workforce	needs.	University	graduates	will	be	 in	high	demand	in	Indonesia	 in	the	next	three	
years.	 	 However,	 while	 the	 current	 university	 system	 is	 considered	 capable	 of	 producing	 the	 right	 number	 of	
university	 graduates,	 there	 is	 concern	 that	 it	 will	 be	 able	 to	 produce	 the	 right	 quality	 of	 university	 graduates.	
Employers	overwhelmingly	express	dissatisfaction	with	the	quality	of	graduates	they	recruit.	
	
Employers	have	also	 reported	disparities	 in	 the	quality	and	 types	of	 skills	 graduates	attain	at	university.	University	
graduates	 with	 similar	 qualifications	 often	 have	 acquired	 considerably	 different	 sets	 of	 skills	 and	 knowledge,	 and	
there	are	large	variations	in	standards.	This	makes	it	difficult	for	employers	to	trust	qualifications	that	students	have.	
Many	employers,	 therefore,	use	 informal	sources	of	 recruitment	rather	 than	official	sources,	which	are	not	 trusted	
and	considered	to	be	out	of	date	or	not	relevant.	Establishing	a	quality	assurance	process	and	a	national	qualification	
framework	will	help	both	university	quality	standards	and	employers	in	trusting	that	graduates	will	have	a	type	and	
standard	of	knowledge	and	skills.	
	
	
	



	

	

	
ASEAN	Economic	Community	
	
The	establishment	of	 the	ASEAN	economic	 community	 (AEC)	 in	2015	was	a	milestone	 in	 integrating	 ten	 Southeast	
Asian	nations	into	a	single	market	for	goods,	services,	capital	and	labour	in	Southeast	Asia.	AEC	areas	of	cooperation	
include	human	resources	development,	capacity	building	and	recognition	of	professional	qualifications,	and	in	2015	
member	countries	endorsed	the	ASEAN	Qualifications	Reference	Framework	(AQRF).	
	
To	facilitate	the	mobility	of	professionals	and	skilled	labour	within	the	Association	of	Southeast	Asian	Nations,	ASEAN	
Mutual	 Recognition	 Arrangements	 (MRAs)	 will	 be	 established	 for	 each	 of	 the	 12	 priority	 sectors	 that	 have	 been	
selected	to	enter	the	ASEAN	Free	Trade	Area	(AFTA).	There	are	currently	3	sectors	in	Indonesia	that	have	completed	
their	MRAs	out	of	 the	agreed	12,	which	 include	Nursing	Services,	Medical	Practitioners	and	Tourism	Professionals.	
However,	according	to	the	Coordinating	Ministry	of	Economic	Sector,	Darmin	Nasution,	the	Indonesian	labour	market	
is	still	considered	unprepared	to	face	the	ASEAN	Economic	Community.	
	
Recognition	of	Prior	Learning	
	
IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	qualification	framework	will	also	open	new	opportunities	that	were	previously	not	possible,	such	as	the	
Recognition	of	Prior	Learning	(RPL).	RPL	is	a	process	conducted	by	formal	institutions	to	assess	skills	and	knowledge	
acquired	 outside	 these	 institutions	 to	 recognize	 a	 competence	 against	 formal	 standards	 or	 competencies.	 In	 the	
education	sector,	the	RPL	allows	access	to	formal	education	while	advocating	the	upgrading	of	skills	and	knowledge	
and	acknowledging	quality	 equivalences	between	education	 institutions.	 In	 the	employment	 sector,	 RPL	 is	 used	 to	
equate	job	qualifications	and	competencies	between	training	providers	and	work	places.	
	
Several	higher	education	institutions	as	well	as	industries	have	implemented	RPL	for	quite	some	time,	but	using	RPL	
on	a	national	scale	has	not	yet	been	done.	Implementing	RPL	is	aimed	to	expand	education	access	for	people	in	the	
labour	market	so	they	can	achieve	higher	qualifications	(i.e.	by	re-entering	formal	higher	education	institutions)	and	
to	 recruit	 professionals	 as	 lecturers.	MoRTHE	 has	 developed	 an	 initial	 plan	 for	 RPL,	 and	 in	 2013	 the	DG	of	Higher	
Education	began	a	pilot	program	in	selected	programmes	in	public	polytechnics.	
	
Professional	Certifications	
	
A	national	 skill	 training	 system	was	developed	 in	 Indonesia	 in	 2003,	 after	 the	 Law	on	Manpower	was	enacted.	 	 In	
addition,	 competency	 standards	 had	 been	 implemented	 in	 the	 skills	 training	 sector	 for	 nine	 years	 before	 the	
Presidential	 decree	 on	 IQF	 was	 issued.	 In	 2014,	 7,580	 private	 providers	 were	 registered	 under	MoM,	 and	 12,591	
under	 MoEC.	 The	 challenge	 facing	 these	 providers	 is	 to	 adjust	 established	 structures	 and	 learning	 outcomes	 to	
comply	with	the	IQF.	
	
The	National	Agency	 for	 Professional	 Certification	or	Badan	Nasional	 Sertifikasi	 Profesi	 (BNSP),	 under	 the	MoM,	 is	
responsible	for	carrying	out	certification	through	the	provision	of	licenses	to	professional	certification	bodies	(PCB	or	
LSP).	 Many	 higher	 education	 institutions	 are	 also	 licensed	 to	 certify	 their	 graduates	 on	 behalf	 of	 professional	
associations.	 In	 specific	 sectors	 such	 as	 health,	 however,	 a	 national	 exit	 examination	 is	 organized	 by	 the	 relevant	
professional	association.	By	the	end	of	2014,	BNSP	licensed	137	LSPs,	mostly	in	manufacturing,	services,	tourism,	and	
general	workers	(including	migrant	workers).	
	
Challenges	and	Recommendations	
	
A	few	main	challenges	and	recommendations	highlighted	by	the	ACDP	report	are	as	follows:	
	
Challenges:	

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Coordination	 between	 the	 relevant	 ministries	 is	 weak	 which	 is	 increasing	 cost,	 causing	 overlapping	
regulation	and	creating	inefficient	bureaucracy;	
	



	

	

	
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Relevant	stakeholders	 including	employers	are	often	not	 included	 in	developing	the	 learning	outcomes	 for	

qualifications,	making	it	less	likely	that	the	defined	learning	outcomes	were	relevant	to	the	workplace;	
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Many	 industries	 have	 already	 established	 competency	 standards,	 which	 may	 bring	 both	 advantages	 and	

challenges	when	attempting	to	synchronize	these	standards	with	the	IQF;	
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ In	 many	 sectors,	 the	 learning	 outcomes	 as	 defined	 by	 providers	 of	 education	 are	 at	 odds	 with	 the	

competencies	required	by	employers.	
	
Recommendations:	

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Establish	 the	 Indonesian	 Qualification	 Board	 (IQB)	 to	 coordinate	 all	 activities	 related	 to	 IQF	 and	 ensure	
synergetic	 effort,	 particularly	 to	 cope	with	 the	 challenges	 of	 AEC	 implementation.	 The	 IQB	 should	 report	
directly	 to	 the	 Office	 of	 the	 President	 or	 the	 State	 Secretariat	 to	 provide	 the	 board	 with	 authority	 to	
coordinate	ministries	and	other	government	agencies	and	to	ensure	a	level	of	independence;	

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Provide	assistance	and	support	to	weaker	 institutions	coping	with	the	new	challenges	of	 implementing	IQF	
while	making	it	clear	to	all	stakeholders	that	the	ultimate	goal	of	introducing	the	IQF	is	to	build	a	culture	of	
quality	within	each	institution;	

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Ensure	 the	 quality	 assurance	 agencies,	 BAN	 PT	 as	 well	 as	 BNSP	 develop	 their	 resources,	 processes	 and	
assessors	to	cope	with	new	challenges;	

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Encourage	 employer	 associations	 to	 establish	 PCB/LSP	 as	 a	 third	 party	 with	 the	 authority	 to	 assess	 and	
award	certificates	to	workers	in	the	relevant	sector.

For their optimal development, each child needs at least one primary caregiver whom he or she trusts and is close to. But parents are not the only ones responsible for children&#39;s welfare. The state and communities also play important roles because a child&#39;s interactions with his or her family and the wider environment will shape the child&#39;s development. The United Nations&#39; Convention on the Rights of Child in 1990 and the 2013 Presidential Regulation in 2013 on Holistic, Integrated Early Childhood Development (HI-ECD) has set the framework that calls for the involvement of the state, agencies and communities. Several ministries in Indonesia have provided services to improve child and family well-being in children&#39;s early years as mandated by the Presidential Regulation on HI-ECD. Before the establishment of Directorate for Parenting Education in MoEC, several government bodies (including the Ministry of Health, the National Board on Family Planning, and the Ministry of Social Affairs) and international NGOs (including Plan Indonesia, Save the Children and World Vision) have operated programs related to family education. These programs most often offer classes to parents and many target poor families or families in poor areas. It is not known how many or which families are being served and whether the same families receive multiple types of services or none at all. The main reason for this is the lack of coordination and insufficient data. It can also be said that the majority of target families may not be receiving all parenting education services at the crucial time when information is needed the most. To produce better results, education programs need to have the right content, delivery and design components.</p>

Negara dan masyarakat juga memainkan peran penting karena interaksi seorang anak dengan keluarganya dan lingkungan yang lebih luas akan membentuk perkembangannya. Konvensi Hak Anak PBB pada tahun 1990 dan Peraturan Presiden pada 2013 tentang Pengembangan Anak Usia Dini Holistik dan Integratif (PAUD - HI) menetapkan kerangka yang membutuhkan keterlibatan negara, lembaga dan masyarakat. Beberapa kementerian di Indonesia telah menyediakan layanan untuk meningkatkan kesejahteraan anak dan keluarga di tahun-tahun awal sebagaimana diamanatkan dalam Peraturan Presiden tentang PAUD - HI.

Program-program biasanya menawarkan kelas untuk orang tua dan lebih banyak membidik keluarga miskin atau keluarga di daerah miskin. Tidak diketahui persis berapa banyak atau berapa keluarga yang dilayani dan apakah keluarga yang sama menerima beberapa jenis layanan atau tidak sama sekali.

Topic	#21	 Family	Education:	A	New	Sphere		

	
Why	Parental	Involvement	in	Education	is	Important	
	
Parents,	or	other	primary	caregivers,	have	the	most	direct	and	powerful	 influence	on	a	childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	well-being	related	to	his	or	
her	physical,	cognitive,	psycho-social	and	emotional	development.	For	their	optimal	development,	each	child	need	at	least	
one	primary	caregiver	whom	he	or	she	trusts	and	 is	close	to.	But	parents	are	not	the	only	ones	responsible	 for	childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	
welfare.	The	state	and	communities	also	play	 important	roles	because	a	childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 interactions	with	his	or	her	family	and	the	
wider	environment	will	shape	the	childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	development.	The	United	NationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	Convention	on	the	Rights	of	Child	in	1990	and	
the	 2013	 Presidential	 Regulation	 in	 2013	 on	 Holistic,	 Integrated	 Early	 Childhood	 Development	 (HI-ECD)	 has	 set	 the	
framework	that	calls	for	the	involvement	of	the	state,	agencies	and	communities.	
	
There	 is	 still	 very	 little	 research	 on	 the	 link	 between	 parenting	 styles	 and	 child	 outcomes	 but	what	 little	 there	 is	 points	
compellingly	to	the	critical	 importance	of	parental	 involvement	 in	a	childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	education.	A	study	by	Harlen	et.	Al.	 found	that	
parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 active	 role	and	partnership	 in	 their	 children	 learning	 can	 improve	 their	 childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	progress	and	 success.	Another	
study	by	the	World	Bank	also	found	better	parenting	knowledge	and	abilities	have	a	positive	correlation	with	their	childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	
development	and	learning	outcomes.	In	another	study	by	the	World	Bank,	it	was	also	argued	that	student	learning	outcomes	
can	 be	 improved	 by	 better	 communication	 between	 school	 and	 parents	 and	 by	 encouraging	 parents	 to	 participate	 in	
monitoring	what	is	going	on	in	their	childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	school.	
	
What	Family	Education	Really	Is	
	
Family	 education	may	 be	 known	 under	 different	 terms	 and	may	 take	 different	 forms,	 ranging	 from	 parenting	 programs,	
parent	education	and	so	on.	However,	the	aim	of	family	education	or	parenting	education	is	clear:	which	is	to	improve	the	
child	 and	 the	 familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 well-being	 by	 creating	 awareness	 of	 the	 importance	 of	 the	 parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 roles	 and	 improving	 their	
contribution	 in	 childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 development	 and	 success.	 Family	 education	 is	 also	of	 course	 closely	 related	 to	 early	 childhood	
development.	Early	Childhood	Development	(ECD)	 interventions	 include	educating	and	supporting	parents,	developing	the	
capacities	of	 caregivers,	 and	using	mass	 communication	 to	enhance	parents	and	caregiversÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 knowledge	and	practice.	 It	 is	
within	 this	 perspective	 that	 the	 Ministry	 of	 Education	 and	 Culture	 (MoEC)	 established	 the	 new	 Directorate	 of	 Family	
Education	Fostering	under	the	Directorate	General	of	Early	Childhood	and	Community	Education.	
	
The	 Directorate	 of	 Family	 Education	 Fostering	 (Direktorat	 Pembinaan	 Pendidikan	 Keluarga/DPPK)	 was	 established	 to	
increase	 parental	 involvement	 and	 contribution	 to	 education.	 According	 to	 the	 Roadmap	 of	 Family	 Education,	 the	
Directorate	will	partner	with	33,000	education	units	across	Indonesia	from	which	3,000	education	units	will	be	selected	to	
become	model	education	units.	These	model	education	units	will	also	receive	facility	and	infrastructure	support	and	capacity	
development.	
	
Several	ministries	 in	 Indonesia	 have	 provided	 services	 to	 improve	 child	 and	 family	well-being	 in	 childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 early	 years	 as	
mandated	 by	 the	 Presidential	 Regulation	 on	 HI-ECD.	 Before	 the	 establishment	 of	 Directorate	 for	 Parenting	 Education	 in	
MoEC,	several	government	bodies	(including	the	Ministry	of	Health,	the	National	Board	on	Family	Planning,	and	the	Ministry	
of	 Social	 Affairs)	 and	 international	 NGOs	 (including	 Plan	 Indonesia,	 Save	 the	 Children	 and	World	 Vision)	 have	 operated	
programs	 related	 to	 family	 education.	Kelas	 Ibu	 (Mother	Class),	which	was	 run	by	 the	Ministry	of	Health,	 is	 provided	 for	
pregnant	 mothers	 and	 mothers	 of	 children	 younger	 than	 five	 years	 old.	 The	 National	 Board	 on	 Family	 Planning	 runs	 a	
program	 for	 parents	 of	 children	 from	 birth	 to	 six	 years	 old	 and	 is	 often	 coordinated	 with	 early	 childhood	 education	
programs.	On	the	other	hand,	the	Ministry	of	Social	Affairs	runs	two	programs	which	specifically	targets	poor	families.	
		
	 	



	

	 2	

These	programs	most	often	offer	classes	to	parents	and	many	target	poor	families	or	families	in	poor	areas.	It	is	not	known	
how	many	or	which	families	are	being	served	and	whether	the	same	families	receive	multiple	types	of	services	or	none	at	all.	
The	main	 reason	 for	 this	 is	 the	 lack	 of	 coordination	 and	 insufficient	 data.	 It	 can	 also	 be	 said	 that	 the	majority	 of	 target	
families	may	not	be	receiving	all	parenting	education	services	at	the	crucial	time	when	information	is	needed	the	most.	Not	
all	aspects	of	early	childhood	are	coordinated	and	there	is	no	clear	champion	among	the	stakeholders	in	the	various	fields.	
However,	although	there	are	such	challenges,	the	government	has	built	a	solid	system	of	early	childhood	education	services	
and	ECD	programs	have	increased	and	improved	over	the	last	decade.	
	
How	to	Move	Forward	with	The	New	Initiative		
	
To	produce	better	results,	education	programs	need	to	have	the	right	content,	delivery	and	design	components.	A	study	by	
the	 World	 Bank	 that	 reviewed	 the	 existing	 parenting	 education	 programs	 and	 provided	 recommendations	 on	 how	
stakeholders	may	better	coordinate,	select	key	messages	and	improve	implementation.	It	was	recommended	that	parenting	
education	providers	 should	select	a	 specific,	meaningful	 set	of	key	mesages	and	adapt	content	 for	particularly	vulnerable	
families.	The	Parenting	Education	Guidebook	and	FacilitatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	Handbook	 for	Parenting	Education	published	by	UNESCO	 in	
2011	 can	 be	 used	 as	 points	 of	 reference	 in	 setting	 key	 messages.	 Recommendations	 to	 improve	 program	 design	 and	
implementation	include	the	following	components:	(i)	active	learning;	(ii)	explicit	goals;	(iii)	sufficient	duration	and	intensity;	
(iv)	practice;	(v)	appropriate	content;	(vi)	responsiveness;	(vii)	community	support;	and	(viii)	trained	and	competent	staff.		
	
The	same	study	also	recommended	steps,	which	can	be	done	simultaneously,	to	improve	the	system	as	follows:	

1. Agreeing	 on	 a	 consensus	 among	 relevant	 stakeholders	 at	 the	 national	 level	 on	 the	 best	 agency	 to	 lead	 and	
coordinate	parenting	education	programs.	

2. Identifying	 knowledge	 gaps	 on	 parenting	 by	 scholars	 and	 academics	 and	 the	 implementation	 of	 research	 on	
parenting	education	while	considering	regional	differences	and	different	types	of	vulnerable	families.	

3. Coordinating	 between	 bodies	 at	 the	 national	 and	 district	 levels	 to	 conduct	 needs	 assessments	 and	 gather	 and	
analyze	data	of	parenting	attitudes,	knowledge	and	skills.	

4. Finalizing	of	a	list	of	national	goals	to	be	addressed	through	parenting	education	programs.	
5. Establishing	and	agreeing	upon	 standards	of	parenting	education	programs	 to	 set	benchmark	 to	be	achieved	by	

each	program.	
6. Identifying	 appropriate	 ministries	 or	 NGOs	 to	 design	 parenting	 education	 programs	 on	 specific	 topics	 and	 for	

specific	audiences	as	well	as	produce	content	and	activity	guidelines	for	facilitators.	
7. Hiring	 and	 training	 facilitators	 with	 relevant	 qualifications	 and	 characteristics	 using	 existing	 training	 providers	

wherever	possible	and	provide	adequate	compensation	to	reduce	turnover.	
8. Conducting	public	relation	campaigns,	parent	outreach	programs	and	bulletins	on	social	media	to	increase	demand	

for	parenting	education	programs	among	parents	and	communities.	
9. Implementing	parenting	education	programs	by	various	responsible	ministries	and	nongovernmental	organizations	

(NGOs),	with	continuous	improvements	based	on	feedback	the	national	lead	agency.	
10. Establishing	an	 independent	monitoring	and	evaluation	 (M&E)	agency	to	design	a	system	capturing	baseline	and	

regular	follow-up	data,	analyzing	results	and	making	recommendations.

Topic #23 Using Education for Tolerance, Peace and Conflict Resolution 

 

  
Pluralistic countries like Indonesia affirm the peaceful coexistence of people with different convictions, interests and 
lifestyles. The Indonesian constitution recognizes religious pluralism and diversity and declares that, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the state 
guarantees all persons the freedom of worship, each according to his/her own religion or beliefÃ¢â‚¬Â (Article 29). 
 
However, acts of intolerance have been making the news in Indonesia and worldwide, and they have called into 
question peoplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ real commitment to principles of pluralism and ideas of equality in diversity.  
 
Many studies indicate that the education sector is best placed to mitigate intolerance and violence by intervening 
early in childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s formation of social and cultural values and stereotypes. Peace education is an essential part of 
UNICEF and UNESCOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s respective visions of quality basic education. UNICEF defines peace education as: 
 

Ã¢â‚¬Å“A process of promoting the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values needed to bring about 
behavior changes that will enable children, youth and adults to prevent conflict and violence, both 
overt and structural; to resolve conflict peacefully; and to create the conditions conducive to 
peace, whether at an intrapersonal, interpersonal, intergroup or international level.Ã¢â‚¬Â 

 
Gender-Based Violence 
 
On 4 May 2016, the Jakarta Post reported a case in which a 14 year-old girl was gang raped by 14 drunken boys and 
then murdered. According to the author of the story, Ã¢â‚¬Å“sexual harassment and violence is still a pervasive problem for 
women in Indonesia.Ã¢â‚¬Â  
 
The author went further and advocated for sexuality education as a means to Ã¢â‚¬Å“educate the young generation to 
understand gender equalityÃ¢â‚¬Â and affect behavioral change.  In addition to policies aimed at combating sexual violence, 
the author claimed: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Education can make it all possible.Ã¢â‚¬Â UN Women might agree with this statement.  According to 
their website, youth education is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬â„¢best betÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for faster sustained progress on preventing and eradicating gender-
based violence. While public policies and interventions often overlook this stage of lifeÃ¢â‚¬Â, the site claims, Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is a critical 
time when values and norms around gender equality are forged.Ã¢â‚¬Â 
 
A study conducted by ACDP on gender equality in education in Indonesia also acknowledged education as a means of 
enabling girls and boys to form and challenge social and cultural values and gender stereotypes.  The study 
emphasized that gender equality does not only mean equality in education access.  Instead, the ways in which girls 
and boys experience teaching and learning can inadvertently reinforce gender stereotypes and Ã¢â‚¬Å“may also favor boys, 
particularly in Indonesia where girls are often discouraged from speaking in public, expressing their opinions or 
questioning male authority.Ã¢â‚¬Â 
 
Religious Intolerance 
 
A video recorded by Kompas TV in Serang Banten went viral this month showing the Public Order Agency (Satpol PP) 
confiscating the food an elderly woman was selling during the month of Ramadan. The woman was seen crying in 
distress as the Satpol PP personnel cracked down against food-stall sellers operating during the daytime hours when 
Muslims were fasting.  
 
 



 

 

Satpol PP head Maman Lufti said the food stall was a legitimate object for the raid because it had opened and was 
selling food during the day. This was thought to tempt those who were fasting.  
 
While restaurant owners who are Muslim often close their businesses voluntarily during Ramadan, food stall owners 
have said they were not aware of rules prohibiting the sale of food during the day.  The food stalls were aiming to sell 
food to those who were not fasting and many of these owners needed the income, especially ahead of the Idul Fitri 
festival.  Many believe the responsibility for resisting temptation to break fast lies with those who are fasting and not 
the food vendors.  
 
Formal Islamic religious education can play a major role in promoting the culture and values of tolerance and peace, 
according to a recent research study supported by ACDP under the leadership of the Directorate of Islamic Education 
and the Ministry of Religious Affairs. The study claimed that many of the values and principles that promote peace are 
already embedded in the curriculum, but need better implementation.  The study also includes recommendations for 
better using formal Islamic religious education to preclude violence. Some of the recommendations include 
integrating values of peace into the formal curriculum and improving the professional competence of Islamic religious 
teachers so they are able to make learning interesting and prevent the loss of students to more extremist influences. 
 
How Can Education Promote Peace? 
 
UNICEF and UNESCO both adopt an approach to peace education including providing children with the right kind of 
school and educational experiences. University of Minnesota researchers, like UNICEF, claim that providing a positive 
and safe school environment where everyone feels safe, respected and engaged is the first crucial element in peace 
education.  
 
UNICEF also highlights the importance of providing environments where peaceful and rights-respected behaviors are 
modeled in the relationships between all members of the school community.  School teachers and headmasters 
should model appropriate conflict resolution during school. Whether conflict is between children or between children 
and adults, it should be dealt with in effective and non-violent ways that are rooted in the local culture. Because 
teaching and learning methods are also important in promoting conflict resolution by encouraging participation, 
cooperation, problem-solving and respect for differences, teacher pre-service training and continuous professional 
development are also essential to implementing peace education. 
 
Peace education should aim to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes that promote peace.  A few examples are as 
follows: 
 

Knowledge Self-awareness, conflict analysis, understanding of rights and responsibility and recognition of 
prejudice. 

Skills Assertiveness, critical thinking, conflict prevention, communication and the ability to generate 
alternative peaceful solutions. 

Attitudes Self-respect, tolerance, acceptance of others, empathy and social responsibility. 

 
Other initiatives related to UNICEF and UNESCOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peace education include childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rights/human rights education; 
gender training, which focuses on resolving conflict specifically related to gender; life skills education, which enables 
children and young people to translate knowledge, attitudes and values into action; and psychosocial rehabilitation, 
which is aimed at children affected by war and violence. Parents play an important role in teaching values of tolerance 
and conflict resolution in the home.  
How Can Curriculum and Learning Content Promote Tolerance and Diversity? 
 
Two examples:  
 

1. A man recently reported online that his second grade son in a public primary school in Jakarta was given an 
assignment, which asked the following questions: 



 

 

a. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kusen and his wife were murdered because (fill in the blank)Ã¢â‚¬Â; and 
b. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Maman told Ijah to get a divorce because: (a) her husband fell into poverty; (b) her husband was a 

spoiled kid; (c) her husband had a mistress.Ã¢â‚¬Â   
 

2. A drawing from an Indonesian textbook illustrates a group of three friends, two female and one male. While 
the female students are shown to constantly ask questions, the male student has the role of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcompetent 
studentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ who always knows and explains the right answer to his classmates.  

 
These two examples illustrate how curriculum content can normalize violence while also reinforcing certain 
stereotypes. However and in contrast, curriculum and textbook contents can be used to enable children to challenge 
stereotypes and form more tolerant values.  
 
Indonesia recently hosted curriculum experts from India and Australia to conduct a rapid review of IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 
curriculum. These experts also shared experiences in using curriculum to indirectly teach diversity and tolerance. In 
her presentation Ã¢â‚¬Å“Curriculum Reform for Quality and Equity in IndiaÃ¢â‚¬Â, Professor Anita Rampal from Delhi University 
explained that the content of the curriculum in India attempts to connect knowledge to life outside the classroom 
while Ã¢â‚¬Å“celebrating diversityÃ¢â‚¬Â. Stories of children from different villages are used to help children appreciate that Ã¢â‚¬ËœfoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 
and Ã¢â‚¬ËœtastesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are cultural constructs. This is one way of enabling children to understand, appreciate and foster 
tolerance of cultural differences. 
 
UNESCO provides support to countries by co-producing textbooks, developing learning materials that are culturally 
and linguistically appropriate, providing support for Member States wishing to revise curricula and textbooks in order 
to remove prejudices or stereotypes and promoting teacher training and educational programs in peace and human 
rights education. 
 
A number of countries such as Liberia, Croatia and Burundi have developed peace education curricula, which consist 
of activities developing skills in communication, cooperation and problem solving. A sample of a peace education 
activity from Yugoslavia is as follows:  
 

Level: Secondary school 

Objective: To help children to understand and tolerate differences in people in terms of their religions, 
cultures, personal values and belief systems. 

Preparation: 1. Select a type of difference you want the children to study; e.g. religious differences, 
racial differences, national differences, occupational differences, etc. 

2. Assign children to study these differences by analyzing their sources and historical 
developments etc. This can be made into a formal assignment.  

Activity: All the children in the class should form pairs, choosing one person to be A and one person to be 
B. In each pair, A assumes the role of one side of a pair of differences (racial, religious, etc.) that 
has been selected. B assumes the other side. Then A speaks out one script for 5 minutes, e.g. 
from a Christian perspective and B listens caringly. B can ask questions for further clarification. 
No argument is allowed. Once AÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turn is over, B speaks out a different script, e.g., as Muslim. 
Then A takes the role of the patient listener. 

Reflection:  Suggested questions to lead the discussion: 
1. What were the feelings you had when listening to someone who was different from 

you? 
2. Did you find it difficult to listen? What made it difficult inside you? 
3. How do you think you can overcome this difficulty? 

 
In another activity, children are each given a quote relevant to conflict resolution from a famous individual. Each child 
then reads their quote in front of the class and the teacher can ask students who are listening to paraphrase what the 
quote means. This helps children form listening skills and understanding while also checking for comprehension. 
 



 

 

Concluding Questions: 
 

- What classroom activities have been used in Indonesia to teach tolerance and prevent violence and anti-
bullying? 

- How can head teachers and teachers serve as role models for promoting tolerance? 
- Should MoEC/MoRA be involved in education for tolerance for parents and communities, e.g. parenting 

education?

Topic	#24	 What	are	Child	Friendly	Schools	and	Why	are	They	Important?	
	

	 	
What	is	an	education?	
	
Many	views	exist	about	the	purpose	of	education.	Some	emphasize	educationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 role	 in	 forming	childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	academic	
skills	 as	well	 as	 the	 technical	 skills	 they	will	 need	 to	 eventually	 transition	 into	 the	world	 of	work.	 Others	 highlight	
educationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 role	 in	 forming	a	 childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 character	and	values	as	well	 as	 supporting	 their	 social,	 emotional	and	physical	
development.	At	OECDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	meeting	on	Skills	for	Social	Progress	in	Sao	Paulo,	Brazil,	in	2014,	policy	makers	agreed	that	
education	should	develop	the	Ã¢â‚¬Å“whole	childÃ¢â‚¬Â	with	a	balanced	set	of	cognitive,	social	and	emotional	skills	enabling	them	
to	better	face	the	challenges	of	the	21st	century.		
	
The	 Harvard	 Professor	 of	 developmental	 psychology,	 Howard	 Gardner,	 changed	 the	 paradigm	 of	 a	 single	 entity	
termed	Ã¢â‚¬Å“intelligenceÃ¢â‚¬Å“	when	in	his	1983	book	Ã¢â‚¬Å“Frames	of	Mind:	The	Theory	of	Multiple	 IntelligencesÃ¢â‚¬Â	he	 identified	7	
different	 types	 of	 intelligence:	 musical-rhythmic,	 visual-spatial,	 verbal-linguistic,	 logical-mathematical,	 bodily-
kinesthetic,	 interpersonal,	 intrapersonal	and	naturalistic.	Ã¢â‚¬Å“Interpersonal	 intelligenceÃ¢â‚¬Â,	for	example,	 is	the	capacity	to	
Ã¢â‚¬Å“detect	 and	 respond	 appropriately	 to	 the	 moods,motivations	 and	 the	 desires	 of	 othersÃ¢â‚¬Â	 whereas	 Ã¢â‚¬Å“intrapersonal	
IntelligenceÃ¢â‚¬Â	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 refers	 to	 the	 capacity	 to	 understand	 onseself,	 appreciate	 oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 feelings	 fears	 and	
motivations.	Existential	and	moral	intelligence	were	also	later	added	by	Gardner.	Each	individual	has	a	unique	blend	of	
intelligences	 and	 GardnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 later	 developed	 the	 idea	 that	 education	 has	 the	 responsibility	 of	 identifying	 the	
individualÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	unique	capacities	and	developing	them	for	their	constructive	use.	The	idea	also	takes	education	out	of	the	
narrow	confines	of	teaching	skills,	curriculum	and	testing	into	a	paradigm	of	how	education	can	assist	people	to	live	
their	lives	well.	The	critical	point	here	is	how	intelligence	and	morality	can	work	together.	
	
Even	 earlier,	 in	 the	 1960s,	 the	 British	 philosopher	 of	 education,	 R.S.	 Peters,	 asked	 his	 readers	 to	 define	 not	 the	
characteristics	of	Ã¢â‚¬Å“quality	educationÃ¢â‚¬Â	but	what	we	mean	by	an	Ã¢â‚¬Å“educated	personÃ¢â‚¬Â.	This	provoked	a	train	of	thought	
that	concluded	with	a	wider	set	of	criteria	for	education	than	the	mere	teaching	of	knowledge	or	technical	skills.	The	
concept	of	an	educated	person	is	usually	understood	as	more	than	just	cognitive	learning	but	also	encompassing	the	
way	the	person	behaves	 in	society	Ã¢â‚¬â€œ	his	moral	behavior	and	ability	 to	 interact	well	with	others.	Peters	paid	specific	
attention	to	the	role	of	the	teacher	and	the	 learning	process.	His	 idea	was	that	teachers	have	a	moral	obligation	to	
respect	 children	 through	 making	 them	 voluntary	 participants	 in	 learning	 and	 letting	 them	 and	 their	 aptitudes	
determine	what	they	consider	worthwhile	to	learn.	
	
Similar	to	R.S.	Peters,	Ki	Hadjar	Dewantara,	a	pioneer	for	Indonesian	education	during	the	Dutch	colonial	era,	argued	
that	the	role	of	the	teacher	was	to	respect	children	by	leading	by	example	and	supporting	their	learning.		His	famous	
proverb	 on	 describing	 the	 ideals	 for	 education	 is	 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ing	 ngarso	 sung	 tulodo,	 ing	 madyo	 mangun	 karso,	 tut	 wuri	
handayaniÃ¢â‚¬Â,	which	translates	Ã¢â‚¬Å“[teachers]	in	front	should	set	an	example,	[those]	in	the	middle	should	raise	the	spirit	
and	[those]	behind	should	give	encouragement.Ã¢â‚¬Â	
	
What	is	the	role	of	a	school	in	educating	the	Ã¢â‚¬Å“whole	childÃ¢â‚¬Â?	
	
While	 schools	 play	 an	 obvious	 role	 in	 supporting	 the	 formation	 of	 cognitive	 skills	 such	 as	 verbal,	 numerical	 and	
linguistic	skills,	it	is	not	always	obvious	how	education	helps	a	child	develop	into	a	moral	individual	or	forms	skills	such	
as	social,	emotional	and	interpersonal	skills.		
	



	

	

However,	it	is	clear	that	schools	do	play	a	crucial	role	in	a	childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	ability	to	form	both	cognitive	and	non-cognitive	skills.	
Children	 are	 not	 born	 with	 fixed	 abilities,	 and	 most	 important	 skills	 are	 malleable,	 meaning	 that	 policy	 makers,	
teachers	and	parents	can	be	strong	influences	by	improving	the	learning	environments	in	which	children	develop.	An	
OECD	report	on	Ã¢â‚¬Å“Skills	for	Social	ProgressÃ¢â‚¬Â,	states	that	the	relationships,	experiences	and	hands-on	learning	acquired	
at	school	can	effectively	give	children	a	sense	of	responsibility	and	form	skills	such	as	teamwork,	empathy,	tolerance	
and	 self-confidence.	 Schools	 are	 also	 young	peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 first	 experience	of	 living	 and	working	with	others	 outside	 the	
home,	including	those	who	differ	from	them	racially,	religiously,	ethnically,	sexually	and	ideologically.	This	experience	
can	enable	them	to	overcome	stereotypes	as	they	work	together,	make	friends,	lose	friends,	argue	their	perspective,	
sharing	social	space,	class	time	and	teacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	attention.	
	
Furthermore,	 Robert	 J.	 Starratt	 argued	 in	 his	 2012	 book,	 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cultivating	 an	 Ethical	 SchoolÃ¢â‚¬Â,	 that	 the	 act	 of	 educating	
young	 people	 is	 as	much	 an	 ethical	 task	 as	 an	 intellectual	 task.	 Starratt	 claimed	 that	 to	 educate	 young	 people	 to	
become	ethical	or	moral	individuals,	the	entire	educational	process	and	purpose	should	be	ethical	and	have	integrity.	
He	calls	the	process	of	establishing	such	school	the	Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cultivation	of	an	Ethical	School.Ã¢â‚¬Â	
	
In	 his	 paper,	 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Child-Friendly	 School-	 A	 Neuropsychology	 PerspectiveÃ¢â‚¬Â,	 Ihshan	 Gumilar	 introduces	 the	 concept	 of	
neuroplasticity	and	defines	it	as	the	ability	of	thought	patterns	to	change	throughout	the	course	of	a	personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	life.	He	
explains	 that	 schools	 can	 be	 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Child	 FriendlyÃ¢â‚¬Â	 by	 utilising	 this	 scientific	 research	 on	 neuroplasticity	 to	 create	 school	
environments,	which	shape	the	 interactions	that	occur	 in	a	school	 in	ways	that	have	a	positive	 impact	on	childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	
learning.		
	
What	are	Ã¢â‚¬Å“Child	FriendlyÃ¢â‚¬Â	Schools?	How	do	they	support	child	development?	
	
The	 concept	 of	 Child-Friendly	 Schools	 emerged	 from	work	 done	 in	 the	mid-1990s	 by	 agencies	 located	 in	 Bangkok,	
including	the	UNICEF	Regional	Bureau	for	Education	and	the	Save	the	Children	Alliance.	Initial	work	on	Child	Friendly	
Schools	focused	on	what	a	school	would	look	like	if	based	on	the	Convention	on	the	Rights	of	the	Child	as	turned	into	
effective	educational	practice	(see	box	below).	According	to	the	UN	Convention	of	the	Rights	of	the	Child,	all	children	
have	the	right	to:	
	

	
1. Be	born,	have	a	name	and	nationality;	
2. Have	a	family	that	is	loving	and	caring;	
3. Feel	safe	and	be	protected	from	violence,	abuse	and	exploitation;	
4. Receive	a	quality	education	and	develop	his/her	potential;	
5. Express	an	opinion	and	be	valued	for	his/her	contributions	
6. Be	given	opportunities	for	play	and	leisure;	
7. Have	adequate	shelter	and	live	in	a	peaceful	community.	

	
	
Around	 1997,	 action	 towards	 establishing	 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Child	 FriendlyÃ¢â‚¬Â	 grew	 along	 with	 the	 emergence	 of	 a	 more	 concrete	
definition	 and	 framework,	 encompassing	 the	 idea	 that	 schools	 should	 enable	 more	 than	 academic	 readiness	 in	
children.	Child	Friendly	Schools	came	to	be	defined	schools	that	operate	in	the	best	interests	of	children,	providing	
the	 appropriate	 social,	 physical	 and	 emotional	 conditions	 to	 promote	 learning	 and	 identity	 formation.	 The	
environment	of	these	schools	was	meant	to	protect	childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	rights	while	leading	to	the	realization	of	the	childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	
full	potential	 in	and	out	of	 school.	This	has	meant	promoting	 inclusiveness,	dignity,	 tolerance,	health,	nutritional	
status	and	well-being	as	well	as	community	support	systems.		
	
UNICEF	characterizes	these	schools	as	Ã¢â‚¬Å“inclusive,	healthy	and	protective	for	all	children,	effective	with	children,	and	
involved	with	families	and	communities-	and	childrenÃ¢â‚¬Â	(Shaeffer,	1999).		



	

	

	
	
What	steps	is	Indonesia	taking	to	develop	schools	that	are	Ã¢â‚¬Å“Child	FriendlyÃ¢â‚¬Â?	
	
The	Government	of	Indonesia	(GoI)	has	recognised	the	necessity	of	a	childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	holistic	development	and	has	supported	
multiple	initiatives,	Laws	and	regulations	aimed	at	supporting	it.	Among	these	are	initiatives	expanding	access	to	Early	
Childhood	Care	and	Education	(ECCE)	as	well	as	Ministerial	Regulation	No.	82	and	actions	towards	establishing	safe	
schools.		
	
Early	Childhood	Care	and	Education:	the	right	time	to	begin	supporting	holistic	child	development	
	
Early	 Childhood	 Care	 and	 Education	 (ECCE)	 has	 been	 recognized	 as	 the	 best	 time	 to	 introduce	 the	 underlying	
principles	 of	 Child-Friendly	 Schools.	 The	 investment	made	 in	 emotional	 and	 social	 skills	 during	 ECCE	 is	 particularly	
important	due	to	the	fact	that	these	skills	build	progressively	on	past	investments	made	into	these	skills.	In	addition,	
those	 with	 strong	 social	 and	 emotional	 skills	 are	 more	 likely	 to	 benefit	 from	 investments	 made	 in	 cognitive	 skills	
during	primary	and	secondary	education.	Small	ability	gaps	can	accumulate	and	lead	to	more	significant	gaps	later	on	
in	life.	Early	childhood	intervention	can	also	include	targeting	disadvantaged	families	and	involving	parents	in	training	
programmes.		
	
Harris	Iskandar,	Director	General	of	Early	Childhood	Education	and	Community	Education,	Ministry	of	Education	and	
Culture,	has	stressed	the	importance	of	Ã¢â‚¬Å“early	childhood	[as]	the	right	time	to	form	character	and	values.Ã¢â‚¬Â	To	this	end,	
The	Ministry	of	Education	and	Culture	(MoEC)	has	set	the	objective	of	ensuring	a	year	of	Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pre-Primary	Education	for	
AllÃ¢â‚¬Â	 while	 continuing	 to	 promote	 the	 national	 agenda	 of	 giving	 every	 community	 access	 to	 a	 quality	 ECCE	 centre.	
MoEC	has	also	called	attention	to	the	importance	of	ensuring	equity	in	access	due	to	the	fact	that	girls	are	enrolling	in	
greater	numbers	than	boys,	and	the	 increasing	percentage	of	enrolled	boys	are	not	completing	the	 full	pre-primary	
year.	 As	 GoI	moves	 forward	 in	 achieving	 its	 ECCE	 objective,	 it	will	 be	 important	 for	 it	 to	 take	 steps	 to	 ensure	 the	
appropriate	 teacher	 training	 and	 quality	 control	 needed	 to	 assure	 that	 ECCE	 fulfills	 its	 potential	 as	 a	 significant	
investment	into	a	childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	social,	emotional	and	holistic	development.		
	
How	do	anti-violent	initiatives	fit	into	the	framework	of	Child-Friendly	Schools?	
	
One	of	the	key	pillars	of	Child	Friendly	Schools	is	the	provision	of	a	healthy,	safe	and	protective	environment.	Schools	
are	also	meant	to	protect	a	childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	right	to	feel	safe	from	violence,	abuse	and	exploitation.	
	
IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	Minister	of	Education,	Anies	Baswedan,	has	recently	called	attention	the	importance	of	preventing	abuse,	
bullying,	harassment,	 fights,	hazing,	exploitation,	molestation,	 rape	and	discrimination	 in	schools.	The	 Indonesian	
Child	Protection	Commission	(KPAI)	reported	that	970	cases	of	bullying	were	reported	in	2014,	an	increase	from	the	



	

	

632	 cases	 recorded	 in	 2013.	 The	 Jakarta	 Post	 has	 also	 reported	 the	 prohibition	 of	 distribution	 and	 publication	 of	
certain	school	textbooks	containing	themes	of	religious	violence	and	racial	discrimination.		
	
Ministerial	Regulation	No.	82	of	2015	on	the	Prevention	and	Countermeasure	of	Violence	 in	Education	Units,	which	
the	Minister	noted	 is	 slated	 to	be	up-scaled	 to	a	Presidential	Regulation,	 requires	 schools	 to	display	a	 sign	on	 safe	
schools	 in	their	hallways	as	well	as	for	teachers	and	principals	to	report	any	violence	at	schools.	The	Minister	has	
also	dedicated	part	of	 the	MoEC	website	 to	 transparency	and	 reporting	of	 violent	acts.	 So	 far,	 12	 cases	have	been	
reported.	 In	addition,	 schools	are	expected	 to	have	anti-violence	units,	which	 include	educators,	 school	committee	
representatives,	 psychologists,	 local	 officials	 and	 local	 religious	 leaders,	 and	 which	 inspect	 schools	 once	 every	 six	
months	 and	 check	 reports	 on	 school	 violence.	 Teachers	 are	 required	 to	 report	 to	 the	 unit	whenever	 they	 suspect	
violent	acts.		
	
Yet,	while	it	 is	easy	to	understand	that	a	violence-free	environment	is	a	prerequisite	to	any	productive	learning,	it	 is	
more	difficult	to	know	how	to	address	the	issue	of	violence	in	a	way	that	best	aids	its	prevention.	Some	have	claimed	
that	 preventing	 violence	 requires	 making	 learning	 materials	 free	 from	 any	 themes	 of	 violence,	 hate	 or	 racial	 or	
religious	 discrimination.	 However,	 recent	 research	 shows	 that	 acknowledging	 violence	 is	 an	 important	 step	 in	
preventing	its	future	occurrence.	Teacher	training	has	also	been	shown	to	be	critical	in	preventing	violence.	Teachers	
need	to	be	trained	to	lead	by	example,	promote	respectful	relationships	at	school	and	teach	students	how	to	resolve	
conflict	without	violent	means.	Future	efforts	towards	establishing	violent	free	environments	might	entail	expanding	
upon	efforts	at	reporting	and	stopping	violent	acts	by	promoting	means	of	prevention	and	resolution.		
	
Conclusion		
	
Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cultivating	an	Ethical	SchoolÃ¢â‚¬Â,	for	Robert	J.	Starratt,	entails	a	process,	instead	of	a	more	easily	measured	outcome	or	
message,	 that	 involves	 creating	ethical	 roles	 for	 school	management	and	 teachers,	 the	 climate	of	 the	 classroom	as	
well	 as	 respectful	 relationships	 with	 students,	 parents	 and	 the	 community.	 Indonesia	 is	 starting	 to	 develop	 such	
processes:	recently,	children	in	Indonesia	had	their	first	day	of	school,	and	GoI	encouraged	parents	to	participate	by	
bringing	their	children	to	their	first	day	of	school,	meeting	the	teachers	and	starting	an	engagement	in	their	childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	
education.	 Indonesia	has	 taken	significant	 steps	 towards	creating	early	 childhood	development	centers	and	schools	
that	serve	the	holistic	development	of	children.		
	
Building	upon	the	momentum	that	Indonesia	has	established	will	now	be	important.	Indonesia	can	continue	efforts	to	
increase	quality	and	access	in	ECCE	and	ensure	a	safe	environment	at	all	levels	of	education.	It	will	also	be	essential	to	
continue	the	conversation	on	the	definition	and	purpose	of	school	and	education,	the	definition	of	what	we	mean	by	
Ã¢â‚¬Å“child	friendly	schoolsÃ¢â‚¬Â	and	Ã¢â‚¬Å“ethical	schoolsÃ¢â‚¬Â,	and	the	best	way	of	addressing	violence	in	schools.	This	is	a	critical	step	
in	 ensuring	 that	 schools	 operate	 in	 the	 best	 interests	 of	 children	 and	 become	 truly	 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ethical	 SchoolsÃ¢â‚¬Â	 dedicated	 to	
developing	the	potential	of	each	child	by	recognizing	the	unique	blend	of	intelligences	in	each	individual	as	well	as	the	
need	to	develop	the	socially	appropriate	aspects	of	moral	behavior	while	ensuring	the	social	justice	and	the	rights	of	
every	child.

School supervisors are meant to ensure that education standards are implemented by 1) inspecting and evaluating and 2) advising, assisting and supporting teachers and school leadership. Current challenges faced by education systems across the world involve combining these two functions of the school supervisor: one that serves as a critical evaluation and the other that serves to support and develop teachers and principals. In decentralized education systems like Indonesia&#39;s, where local governments, schools and communities are participating more and more in the educational decision-making process, school supervisors are particularly important. In a decentralized system, supervisors fortify a strong system of accountability in which 1) teachers are held accountable to students, parents, communities and head teachers; 2) school management is held accountable to government. There is wide agreement that the system of school supervision in Indonesia needs improvement. Supervisors are used sporadically and their use varies across regions. However, even in areas that do use supervisors, the supervisory role is shown to focus mainly on administrative rather than quality issues.</p>

School Supervisors: the Hidden (yet Crucial) Link in Assuring Accountability and Quality in 
Education 

 

  
What role does the school supervisor play in education?  
 
School supervisors play a vital role in an education systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accountability and quality assurance frameworks. 
Supervisors are expected to act both as education managers and also pedagogical leaders, or Ã¢â‚¬Ëœleaders of learning.Ã¢â‚¬Â 
School supervisors are meant to ensure that education standards are implemented by 1) inspecting and evaluating 
and 2) advising, assisting and supporting teachers and school leadership. Current challenges faced by education 
systems across the world involve combining these two functions of the school supervisor: one that serves as a critical 
evaluation and the other that serves to support and develop teachers and principals. 
 
Internationally, school inspection has had a long history, going back to 1834 in England when Her MajestyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 
Inspectorate was founded and became a model in a number of developing countries.  In France, school inspection 
started in the Napoleonic era and has been emulated by various colonies. After having lost influence during the 1970s, 
school inspection gained renewed interest and was rebranded supervision in the 1990s. Renewed interest arose due 
to the rapid expansion of education and corresponding concern about deterioration in education quality, the 
attention given to international student assessments, higher accountability and demands for Ã¢â‚¬Ëœvalue for moneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in 
education, more autonomy given to teachers and studies showing a link between deteriorating quality and a 
weakening of quality monitoring devices.  
 
In decentralized education systems like IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, where local governments, schools and communities are 
participating more and more in the educational decision-making process, school supervisors are particularly 
important. In a decentralized system, supervisors fortify a strong system of accountability in which 1) teachers are 
held accountable to students, parents, communities and head teachers; 2) school management is held accountable 
to government. 
 
School supervisors in Indonesia 
 
IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s school supervisors (pengawas sekolah) are an important part of a devolved accountability system and 
quality framework and report to the local education office, the Ministry of Religious Affairs or other ministries or non-
ministerial state institutions at the provincial, regent or city level.  
 
Ministerial Regulation of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform No. 21 of 2010 describes the supervisor as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“civil 
servant...responsibleÃ¢â‚¬Â¦to conduct academic and managerial supervision on education unitsÃ¢â‚¬Â. School supervisors are 
required in order to meet Minimum Service Standards (MSS), and the competencies required of school supervisors are 
further defined in Ministerial Decree 12/2007. Ministerial Regulation No. 21 of 2010 also outlines the main tasks of 
supervisors, which include monitoring the implementation of IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 8 National Education Standards, planning 
and implementing supervision and assessment, supervising and conducting teacher professional training, including 
through teacher and principal working groups such as KKG/MGMP/MGBK/KKKS and MKKS.  
 
There is wide agreement that the system of school supervision in Indonesia needs improvement. Supervisors are used 
sporadically and their use varies across regions. However, even in areas that do use supervisors, the supervisory role is 
shown to focus mainly on administrative rather than quality issues.  
 



 

 

What competencies should supervisors have? 
 
MSS and school accreditation in Indonesia set standards for education input such as equipment, facilities and teacher 
qualifications, etc., and one task of the supervisor is to ensure these input meet designated standards. However, an 
even more critical function of supervisors is to ensure education processes such as the teaching and learning process, 
which are harder to measure than education input, are also of adequate quality. By ensuring quality processes, 
supervisors then help ensure quality education output such as student achievement.  
 
To evaluate and improve education processes, supervisors should be able to identify quality teachers and help weak 
teachers improve. Thus, they need knowledge and understanding about the teaching learning process, the roles of 
teachers and principals and the function of National Education Standards in improving learning. Such knowledge will 
be particularly important to support teachers in achieving the paradigm shift proposed by curriculum 2013, marked by 
an interactive teaching and learning process with effective classroom based assessment.  
 
However, a review conducted by the Australia-Indonesia Basic Education Project found supervisors to have a number 
of deficiencies in the knowledge and skills they would need to improve education processes such as student learning. 
A 2013 ACDP survey of supervisors and principals validated that supervisors were deficient in competencies needed to 
improve learning. The survey rated supervisors (through self-ratings and ratings by teachers and principals) on the 
following competencies: 
 

Supervisor competencies used for ACDP survey 

 
1. Personality/character; 
2. Social (taking an active role in the supervisorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ association, etc.); 
3. Managerial supervision (ability to prepare supervision reports and ability to use supervision 

results to plan for further development, etc.); 
4. Academic Supervision (knowledge and understanding of concepts and principles of the 

learning process and ability to guide teachers, etc.) 
5. Educational Evaluation (ability to develop indicators of learning achievement and guidance 

and ability to process and analyze performance data for teachers and principals, etc.); and 
6. Research and Development (ability to master a variety of research methods). 

 
The survey revealed that supervisors generally were rated high in Ã¢â‚¬Å“SocialÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“PersonalityÃ¢â‚¬Â dimensions of 
competencies and low in Ã¢â‚¬Å“ResearchÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Academic SupervisionÃ¢â‚¬Â, with considerable variation between regions. This 
means that supervisors were found to lack competency in skills such as providing advice to teachers about effective 
teaching and learning as well as analyzing and using performance data to improve educational quality and outcome.  
 
Further, field studies showed that a significant proportion of supervisors had little understanding about the content of 
National Education Standards or how such standards could be used to benefit schools and student learning. The ACDP 
survey corroborated these findings by indicating that virtually no supervisors made the link between achieving 
education standards and improving student learning.  
 
How can the recruitment process of school supervisors help ensure selection of the right candidates? 
 
Many publications on school supervision in Indonesia suggest that the system of recruiting school supervisors is a key 
challenge as it is shown to be based less on competencies and qualifications than on favoritism and political 
considerations at the local level.   
 
Ministerial Regulation 21 of 2010 requires supervisor positions to be held only by teachers with civil servant status. 
Given the role of supervisors in evaluating and supporting school principals and school management, some have 



 

 

suggested that supervisors should also have experience in principal or school leadership positions. The ACDP survey 
showed that a larger percentage of MoEC supervisors are being appointed from principal positions than are MoRA 
supervisors. This does not mean that MoEC pengawas are more capable than MoRA pengawas, but it does mean they 
had more experience in school leadership and management. The same percentage of MoEC and MoRA supervisors 
held teaching certificates before they were appointed to supervisor positions.  
 
Does effective training and CPD for school supervisors exist? 
 
LPPKS provides principal preparation programs, but there is yet no equivalent for supervisors. ACDPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2013 survey of 
supervisors in Indonesia suggests that participation in INPRES training did had a positive impact on supervisor 
competency.  Participants were particularly positive about the balance between face-to-face training, workplace 
application and mentoring. However, more research needs to be done to determine whether training leads to 
improvement in education quality and student learning outcome.  
 
The ACDP survey also revealed that supervisors undertook minimal continued professional development (CPD) 
training in the three years prior to the study. The minority of supervisors who did claim to have received training, 
mostly those from MoEC, received training through mentoring from other supervisors or special training programs. A 
close analysis of supervisor comments about the training they received after appointment does not indicate that they 
participated in a specially planned induction program with mentoring and performance management support. 
 
What is the role and challenges facing school supervisors outside of Indonesia?  
 
Decentralization of education administration and management and the corresponding demand for greater local 
accountability and efficiency is under way in other Asian countries such as Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, China and 
India. As these countries strengthen their school supervision services, debate continues about whether school 
supervision systems should function as a critical external evaluation (inspection) or a supportive advisory process 
(supervision).  
 
Malaysia has been developing a more critical supervision system or school Ã¢â‚¬Å“auditÃ¢â‚¬Â that is carried out by a team 
inspectors located external to the school which regularly visits and inspects schools. This type of supervision system is 
based on the one set up by the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) in the late 1980s in England and Wales. The 
Republic of Korea also uses Ã¢â‚¬Å“externalÃ¢â‚¬Â evaluators from the provincial and metropolitan offices of education who are 
located outside of the school to administer school evaluations. While MalaysiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s system covers the whole operation of 
the school, KoreaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uses appointed evaluation committees that do not follow uniform criteria. Both systems send the 
results of evaluations to the government, and, in the case of Korea, use results to financially reward well-performing 
schools.  
 
In contrast, countries like Kenya, Bangladesh and Nigeria have placed more focus on the supervisorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role in 
supporting and developing teachers instead of their role in inspecting and critically evaluating. These countries have 
adopted the premise that Ã¢â‚¬Å“control without support will not lead to quality improvementÃ¢â‚¬Â. Bangladesh and Kenya 
expect supervisors to have many roles such as that of head teachers; classroom teachers; guides and counselors to 
teachers; liaison between the school; the community and external agencies; a key organizer of school functioning; and 
as administrator and academic planner.  
 
Many countries such as the Philippines, Chile and Australia are attempting to develop a system of supervision that is 
both critical and supportive. For example, each school in Victoria, Australia, annually prepares a self-assessment 
report by collecting, analyzing and reporting certain data. During this process, school principals work closely with 
teachers to improve the teaching learning process. Critical inspection occurs every three years by external firms that 
evaluate the schoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance, report to the government and send recommendations to schools.   
 



 

 

When considering the systems of school supervision established in other countries, should the role of school 
supervisors in Indonesia be rethought?

Topic #26 
 
Managing Diversity and Preserving Harmony through Education  
 

 
Diversity is one of IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique characteristics where diverse culture, religions and ethnic groups live side by 
side. The government had established its commitment in ensuring one form of tolerance, which is religious 
tolerance, in the Constitutional Law under Article 29: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The State guarantees all persons the freedom of worship, 
each according to his/her own religion or beliefÃ¢â‚¬Â. 
 
Historically, religions came into Indonesia through trade and they had spread through informal and non-formal 
education. Their development processes may be explained by the peaceful approach done by their missionaries 
and the local culture that are relatively tolerant such as that in Singaraja, Buleleng regency in Bali, where religious 
tolerance is a part of their culture that has been passed down through generations. 
 
However, religious tolerance in Indonesia is not something taken for granted in all regions in Indonesia and it is not 
a permanent situation. Instead, religious tolerance is dynamic and therefore must be maintained. In 2015, the 
Ministry of Religious Affairs through the Center for Religious Life, and the Education, Training, Research and 
Development Agency conducted a survey to measure and provide a snapshot of Religious Tolerance (Kerukunan 
Umat Beragama/KUB) in the provincial capitals. The results indicated that the level of religious tolerance in 
Indonesia is still quite high (75.36 out of 100) compared to the previous survey in 2012. 
 
Nevertheless, on a case-by-case basis, there are still problems of intolerance in Indonesia. It was also indicated in a 
survey conducted by the Center of Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). The survey which was conducted in 
23 provinces showed that the condition of intolerance is increasing, particularly intolerance related to the 
construction of houses of worship by other religions in the neighborhood. At the provincial level, the Institute of 
Social Studies and Religion (Lembaga Studi Sosial dan Agama/eLSA) in Semarang have also assessed that the 
Central Java province can be categorized as an area rife with intolerance towards freedom of belief and expression. 
This is proven by the 14 cases of intolerant act in 2015. 
 
As it is not a permanent situation, religious tolerance must always be maintained. The government and the public 
have the same interest in creating harmony, managing diversity and maintaining tolerance. As stated by the 
Director General of UNESCO in a related International Conference in Austria on learning to live together:  
 

Ã¢â‚¬Å“At a time of increasing global challenges and threats, such as inequality, exclusion, violence and sectarianism 
worsened by local tensions and conflicts which undermine humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cohesion, learning to live together 
among all members of the global community becomes more topical than ever before.Ã¢â‚¬Â 

 
The Role of Education in Promoting Harmony  
 
The State is responsible to ensure that its citizens can exercise their basic rights and be free from any acts of 
discrimination through laws and regulations. Furthermore, as indicated by various studies, education is the best 
vehicle to address intolerance and violence within individual capacities that can disrupt harmony. Teaching 
tolerance is done by intervening childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s understanding in the early stages of stereotyping and developing 
cultural-social values.  
 



 

 
The curriculum design of IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s education has initiated these steps by incorporating Religious Education and 
Civic Education which also teach values of diversity that refer to the Pancasila, particularly its third point. In the 
National Medium Term Development Plan 2015-19, the values and culture of peace are emphasized through 
religious education, and specifically includes the development of religious attitudes and behavior that promotes 
tolerance and mutual respect among people of different religions. This has established a strong basis for 
integrating the values and culture of peace into religious education in schools. 
 
According to a study supported by ACDP Indonesia commissioned by the Directorate of Islamic Education, formal 
Islamic education possesses an important role to promote the culture and values of tolerance and peace. This 
study states that there are already values and principles which promote peace, inherent within the curriculum. 
However, better implementation is needed. The study also provides recommendations in order for formal Islamic 
religious education can be better taught to prevent violent acts.  
 
At the higher level, education is also important to shape tolerance towards diversity and foster harmony. A part of 
the society that can play an active role in maintaining harmony are higher-education students who have great 
potential in creating a certain form of order in the society. Apart from being responsible of the nation's future, 
higher-education students also act as the agent of change, because of their educational level is higher than the 
general public. A survey conducted by SETARA Institute in 2008 on respondents of the higher-education age (17-22 
year old) showed that 87.1% of the respondents did not make religious difference as a barrier in making friends 
and about 67.4% of the respondents could accept the fact of religious conversion. 
 
Another study conducted by the Center of Research and Development for Religious Life (Puslitbang Kehidupan 
Keagamaan) in 2010 studied the influence of personality, organization involvement, religious education study and 
educational environment towards studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ religious tolerance in several public universities. The study shows that 
educational environment has the greatest direct influence (by 7.2%) on religious tolerance with the coefficient of 
0.269, which means that a positive educational environment can help foster a culture of harmony in university 
students. Instead, the study of religious education has the smallest effect (by 1.2%) compared to other factors. 
 
An example of activities in higher education that promotes a culture of tolerance and religious tolerance was 
undertaken by the Japanese Literature program and the Center for Japanese Studies at the National University. 
Both held a student forum in which a group of Japanese students from Chuo University in Tokyo, Japan to 
participate. One of the themes discussed at the forum was the ""Concept of Religion in Indonesia and Japan"" where 
students explain and discuss about religious concepts in the two countries. 
 
Furthermore, the Ministry of Religious Affairs has also been working with the Kwartir Nasional in organizing 
Wirakarya Camping of Religious Higher Education (Perkemahan Wirakarya Perguruan Tinggi Keagamaan), where 
many Islamic and non-Islamic higher education institutions participate. This camping activity aimed to provide a 
forum to increase religious tolerance among higher-education students of religious colleges through scout 
activities. 
 
International Practices  
 
On the other hand, countries such as Malaysia, Morocco, and the United Kingdom have integrated peace 
education into their curriculum according to their social, cultural, historical and environmental context of each 
country.  
 
In Malaysia, where the majority of citizens are Muslim and Islam has been declared the state religion, education on 
the culture and values of peace has been integrated into Islamic religious education through the development of a 
humanistic Islam uses the perspective of global Islam. For non-Muslim students, these values are taught through 
character-building education and physical education. 



 

 
Morocco, a monarchy based on an Islamic constitution, introduced a murshidat program that promotes the values 
of tolerance and mutual respect in the spirit of the Islamic Sufi. The program aims to involve women in the 
education of Islamic tolerance, introducing changes to the code of conduct of women to support for the rights of 
women and provide training for the Dai (Islamic extension missionaries). 
 
In the United Kingdom, education on the values and culture of peace is implemented through religious education. 
However, this is done without placing too much emphasis on doctrine or practice of a specific religion. On the 
contrary, religious education aims to build inter-religious understanding, social cohesion, critical thinking skills, and 
social and moral development.

Indonesia has reached the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) target of achieving national teen literacy with rates of those aged 15-24 being high since 1990 and approaching 100% in 2015. The exception is Papua Province where only 87.2% of teens are shown to be literate. Gender equality in teen literacy has also been achieved in most areas in Indonesia. However, Indonesia has not performed well in international literacy assessments. Teachers can greatly improve reading skills in Indonesia. Reading for pleasure has shown to benefit children&#39;s reading achievement significantly and can help children with lower cognitive ability by building vocabulary and general knowledge. Parents and teachers have also shown to be able to influence children&#39;s desire to read by providing motivation in the form of recognition, rewards or incentives. Technology, such as digital devices like the tablet computer, though criticized for distracting children from activities such as reading and decreasing their ability to recall and comprehend information, has been suggested by many research to have many benefits, including enhancing literacy development and language acquisition. Furthermore, children&#39;s libraries can help the process of learning to read and to giving children access to all media.</p>

Membaca di waktu luang memberikan manfaat bagi prestasi anak-anak secara signifikan dan dapat membantu anak-anak yang memiliki kemampuan kognitif lebih rendah dengan cara menambah kosa kata dan pengetahuan umum. Orang tua dan guru juga dapat mempengaruhi keinginan anak-anak untuk membaca dengan memberikan motivasi dalam bentuk pengakuan, penghargaan atau insentif. Teknologi, misalnya perangkat digital seperti komputer tablet, meskipun dikritik karena mengganggu kegiatan anak dalam membaca dan mengurangi kemampuan dalam mengingat dan memahami informasi, telah disarankan oleh banyak penelitian karena memiliki banyak manfaat, diantaranya ialah meningkatkan pengembangan literasi dan penguasaan bahasa.

Topic #29 

 

Sumba: Using Research for Making Policy Adjustments for Disadvantaged Regions  

 

 

Background 

 

Sumba is one of the major islands within the Province of Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT), Indonesia. It is located between 

Sumbawa Island to the northwest and Timor Barat to the East. All four districts in Sumba are categorized as 

underdeveloped regions based on their human resource indicators that are lower than the national average. 

Moreover, based on an index constructed from the national village potential database (PODES), 60% of SumbaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 

village communities are disadvantaged and 13% can be considered as remote. 

 

As a disadvantaged region, Sumba provides a good example of the use of educational research to inform policies, 

particularly those aiming to improve education quality in disadvantaged schools. Based on ACDP work in rural and 

remote education initiatives in Papua, the provincial government had invited ACDP to discuss the critical concerns 

related to education performance in NTT, and ultimately in Sumba. 

 

The ACDP Report as Part of the Knowledge Creation to Inform Policy in Sumba 

 

The ACDP 040 study Ã¢â‚¬Å“Strategies for Improving Basic Education School/Madrasah Effectiveness in Sumba, NTTÃ¢â‚¬Â is 

intended to respond to the priority concerns of the governments and stakeholders of the four districts of Sumba, 

especially for disadvantaged schools. An initial discussion with Sumba stakeholders in January 2014 produced a list of 

priority issues which includes the proportion of untrained teachers, PNS teacher supply and distribution, sustainable 

resourcing for private schools, the quality of teaching and childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s readiness to learn. Starting with these priority 

issues, a number of studies were developed, including a Comprehensive Situation Analysis and a Review of School 

Evaluation Mechanism. 

 

The Comprehensive Situation Analysis (CSA) provides evidence of the situation in Sumba primary schools as a basis to 

develop policy options. It highlights the significantly high repetition rate in Year 2 and it is at this grade that the 

proportion of students having difficulties in reading was quite high. The analysis finds that the repetition rate varies 

from 12% to 21% in the four districts and about 30% of Year 2 students have difficulties in reading in the sample 

schools. The high repetition rate and low reading abilities indicate low learning quality in the early grades, calling for 

the need to test students in Year 2 or 3, to monitor if students have the basic foundation for future learning. 

 

The teachers and education personnel are also a main issue in the overall education system in Sumba. Teachers with 

an S1 qualification or teachers with civil servant or Pegawai Negeri Sipil (PNS) status are not evenly distributed across 

the island. Out of the sample schools, more than two third of teachers are only SMA graduates. The same applies to 

principals, where 42% are SMA graduates. In fact, as many as 60% of teachers working in Sumba are not PNS teachers 

and do not have the necessary qualifications. These teachers, who constitute a critical component of the teacher 

workforce are therefore considered as SumbaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsecond workforceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ although they lack support in terms of policy, 

adequate salaries and incentives, thus presenting a major problem for achieving education quality. 

 

There are also positive findings, such as despite their poor performance in reading tests in Bahasa Indonesia, the  

same students are nevertheless able to comprehend while listening to texts being read aloud in their mother tongue.  

When using the mother tongue in this way, about 75% students were able to answer correctly more than 50% of the 

oral comprehension questions. For students, who do not know the written structure of language and vocabulary, their 

speaking and listening ability in their mother tongue is the basic potential to develop reading comprehension when 



 

 

they have mastered the prerequisite decoding skills. The study also found a high level awareness of the value of early 

childhood education (PAUD) and the recognition of the need for quality provision to support school readiness.  

 

Policy Domain and Options from the Sumba Situation Analysis 

 

Effective teaching 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Trainings through the teacher working group (KKG) as an affordable systematic way; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Improvement of qualification-based training by exploring better adaptation of PGSD S1 to the Sumba context, 
through improving relevance of PGSD S1 in existing pre-service institutions and expanding enrolment through 

MOU arrangements; 

 

Curricular effectiveness 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Greater focus on literacy in the curriculum of the early grades, including providing curriculum guidelines for the 
TK sub-sector, curriculum guidelines for teaching basic components of reading in the early grades, and developing 

a policy around language of instruction using the mother tongue in PAUD and early grades learning; 

 

School leadership 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  LPPKS (PrincipalsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Institute) to be involved in the role of providing eligible candidates for school principals or in 
sharing the training costs through MoUs between the LPPKS and the district;  

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Continuous professional development for principals through well-programmed principalsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ working groups 
(Kelompok Kerja Kepala Sekolah/K3S); 

 

School evaluation 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Ownership of the school evaluation by the district Dinas Pendidikan and the processes relevant to effective 
schooling should be initiated by and reported to the district; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Evaluation against baselines of schoolsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ own performances; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Administration of school evaluation within existing assessment capacity in all districts; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Parents and village community participation in the schoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evaluation; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Linking school evaluation into a purpose and a program for improvement; 
 

Integrated teacher workforce policy 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  A recruitment policy based on relevant teacher standards and teacher-class ratio; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Equalisation of remuneration and conditions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at least as amongst the non-PNS teachers; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Development of career paths for non-PNS teachers; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Performance management including outcome indicators such as classroom assessment; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Equalized distribution of qualified teachers to rural and remote schools; 
 

Remote school support 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Pre-programmed tablet-based delivery of professional development resources; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  A mobile service for remote schools by a mobile team for a week-long visit once per semester; 
 

Readiness of children for school 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Coordinated cross-sectoral district-level task forces to advocate for and support an expanded village role in 
supporting childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s readiness for learning, supported also by a Bupati decree for its establishment. 

 

 

All districts took significant steps in policy development from a prioritization of three of the most important policy 

areas. The first one is the continuous professional development for early grade teachers, particularly in teaching 

literacy, through teacher working group (KKG). The second one is efforts towards equalized distribution of quality 

teachers for disadvantaged schools. The third one is reforms of school principal recruitment. Although no districts 

have explicitly articulated development of a non-PNS teacher workforce policy, all districts have taken efforts directed 



 

 

to that framework. Outside the priority areas above, responses have been modest rather than breakthrough. But 

some value has also emerged from these modest actions. 

 

The Knowledge-to-Policy Practice in Sumba  

 

When findings from the analytical studies were presented to the district leadership, all decision makers agreed to 

support the formation of a leadership taskforce to take action turn knowledge to policy actions. This was the start of 

the Forum Peduli Pendidikan SumbaÃ¢â‚¬â€FPPS (Advocacy Forum for Sumba Education) which was to play an important 

role in initiating SumbaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s policy development. The forum consisted of the Vice Bupati in each district, the head of the 

Dinas Pendidikan and Bappeda in each district as the line departments supporting the policy leaders in technical 

aspects. From its inception, the FPPS was perceived by the leadership as having  a future beyond functioning as 

merely the trigger for policy formation in issues related to school effectiveness.. Since the first meeting, the FPPS has 

also assumed the role of monitoring and coordinating the commitment of all districts to take policy action for 

education reform. A standing agenda item of the FPPS meetings was to report on progress on their policy adoption, 

resourcing and regulation. 

 

Policy option areas were developed from the analysis and findings provided by the studies. After presentation of the 

findings, a subsequent meeting resulted in the agreement of all four districts to develop the policies and strategies 

that they would adopt and further consult and negotiate with the central government. Districts identified their own 

scope for policy action, including the estimated budgets, and the identification and documentation of aspects of 

national policies and regulations that would seem to constrain the achievement of quality primary education. Such 

issues include the undersupply of PNS teachers and challenges of placing PNS teachers in private schools.  

 

A follow-up meeting in Jakarta in September was the Central-Regional Dialogue in which all four districts brought their 

concerns to the central government, including with the Ministry of Education and Culture, Ministry of Religious 

Affairs, and Ministry of State Apparatus. The central-regional dialogue was opened by the Minister of Education and 

Culture, and the Ministry's Directorates-Generals were substantively engaged in the discussions.  

 

The dialogue is seen as a solution-seeking policy mechanism between the centre and the regions. The issues and 

solutions brought by the Sumba leadership were aligned with the PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s policy of Ã¢â‚¬Å“building from the peripheryÃ¢â‚¬Â. 

There was also a proposal for making Sumba a model of central-regional policy interaction, which was strongly 

supported by the NTT provincial government. 

 

With the writing of its constitution, the FPPS has emerged as a local mechanism for policy development for education 

reform. Building on the policy dialogues held in September, the FPPS has also prepared official letters to the Minister 

of Education and Culture requesting his support for the consideration of a set of policy adjustments. These letters 

were issued by the Bupati in each district and delivered by the FPPS to the Minister. 

 

The Future of Education Policy Development in Sumba 

 

Sumba now has a dedicated mechanism for policy review and development. The districts are now equipped for 

negotiating policy positions with the central government, and this serves as a potential model for disadvantaged, rural 

and remote districts. But resourcing and policy implementation requires systemic capacity as well as political drivers. 

As with the areas of technical capacity that need a longer time frame for development, there are some key processes 

that need to be in place in order to sustain the policies that districts have adopted: 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Evaluation of schools and learning linked to systemic processes through the district Dinas Pendidikan, 
triggering intervention, strategy review, planning and budgeting; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Analysis of districtsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ education financing; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Government-wide usage of Dapodik data, recognized as the comprehensive data source for planning and 
projections. 

 



 

 

National policies that impact fiscal capacity of the districts must also be reviewed in order for the districts to 

adequately resource quality development. Other national policies, such as in the PAUD sector and the village fund 

allocation, may also require significant adjustment to yield the potential for improvement in educational quality.

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ All	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â should	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â formally	 Ã‚Â certified	 Ã‚Â after	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â four-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyear	 Ã‚Â degree	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â gained.	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Professional	 Ã‚Â  allowances	 Ã‚Â  should	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  granted	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  certified	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  equal	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  their	 Ã‚Â  base	 Ã‚Â  salary	 Ã‚Â  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ
therefore	 Ã‚Â effectively	 Ã‚Â doubling	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â income	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â certified	 Ã‚Â teachers.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Teachers	 Ã‚Â  must	 Ã‚Â  work	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  mandatory	 Ã‚Â  24	 Ã‚Â  period-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âhour	 Ã‚Â  (18-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âhour)	 Ã‚Â  per	 Ã‚Â  week	 Ã‚Â  workload	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  gain	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â 
maintain	 Ã‚Â certification.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â positives	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
1. Better	 Ã‚Â pay	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â higher	 Ã‚Â welfare	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Before	 Ã‚Â  2005,	 Ã‚Â  teacher	 Ã‚Â  incomes	 Ã‚Â  were	 Ã‚Â  low	 Ã‚Â  relative	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  other	 Ã‚Â  occupations	 Ã‚Â  requiring	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  similar	 Ã‚Â 
educational	 Ã‚Â  level.	 Ã‚Â  Indonesian	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â salaries	 Ã‚Â compared	 Ã‚Â unfavourably	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â those	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â 
in	 Ã‚Â Malaysia,	 Ã‚Â Thailand	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Philippines.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â status	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â profession	 Ã‚Â was	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â lower	 Ã‚Â 
than	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â status	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â professions.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â professional	 Ã‚Â allowances	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â changed	 Ã‚Â this	 Ã‚Â situation.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 



	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ As	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â  result,	 Ã‚Â  fewer	 Ã‚Â certified	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â now	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â second	 Ã‚Â  jobs	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â  fewer	 Ã‚Â worry	 Ã‚Â about	 Ã‚Â providing	 Ã‚Â 
adequate	 Ã‚Â financial	 Ã‚Â support	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â their	 Ã‚Â families.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

2. Higher	 Ã‚Â status	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Better	 Ã‚Â  pay	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  certified	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  aligned	 Ã‚Â  teachersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â  status	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â  professions	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â 

law	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  medicine	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  provided	 Ã‚Â  effective	 Ã‚Â  incentives	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  upgrade	 Ã‚Â  their	 Ã‚Â 
qualifications.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Principals	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  feel	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â perception	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  teaching	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  career	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  improving	 Ã‚Â  rapidly	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â now	 Ã‚Â attracted	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â enter	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â profession	 Ã‚Â because	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â these	 Ã‚Â policies.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
3. Higher	 Ã‚Â calibre	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â entrants	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ As	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â  result	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  teaching	 Ã‚Â becoming	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â attractive,	 Ã‚Â better-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âqualified	 Ã‚Â high	 Ã‚Â  school	 Ã‚Â graduates	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â 
entering	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â training	 Ã‚Â  institutions	 Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€œ	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â average	 Ã‚Â national	 Ã‚Â exam	 Ã‚Â score	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â entrants	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â 
increased.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â negatives	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
1. No	 Ã‚Â impact	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â learning	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Teacher	 Ã‚Â  certification	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  had	 Ã‚Â  no	 Ã‚Â  impact	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  student	 Ã‚Â  learning	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  there	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  no	 Ã‚Â  evidence	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â 
certification	 Ã‚Â makes	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â teach	 Ã‚Â better.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ This	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  largely	 Ã‚Â because	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â bar	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â become	 Ã‚Â certified	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â set	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â comparatively	 Ã‚Â  low	 Ã‚Â 
level	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â nearly	 Ã‚Â 100%	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â pass.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â universities	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â training	 Ã‚Â courses	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â highly	 Ã‚Â variable	 Ã‚Â and,	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â 
average,	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â do	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â gain	 Ã‚Â enough	 Ã‚Â extra	 Ã‚Â knowledge	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â obtaining	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â degree.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
Policy	 Ã‚Â options	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 

Raise	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â bar	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ It	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â important	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â keep	 Ã‚Â raising	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â bar	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â certification	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â ensure	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â certification	 Ã‚Â signals	 Ã‚Â 
something	 Ã‚Â reliable	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â meaningful	 Ã‚Â about	 Ã‚Â what	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â know	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â do.	 Ã‚Â (OECD	 Ã‚Â 2015)	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
Improve	 Ã‚Â pre-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âservice	 Ã‚Â training	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Improve	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â operation	 Ã‚Â  licensing	 Ã‚Â mechanism	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â accreditation	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â programmes	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â ensure	 Ã‚Â 
that	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â programmes	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â good	 Ã‚Â quality.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Ensure	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â trainers	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â experienced	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â developing	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â career	 Ã‚Â path	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â 
teaching	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â training.	 Ã‚Â (ACDP	 Ã‚Â forthcoming	 Ã‚Â -Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â	 Ã‚Â prep	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â dev)	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Teacher	 Ã‚Â  training	 Ã‚Â  institutions	 Ã‚Â  should	 Ã‚Â  learn	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  balance	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  practical	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  theoretical	 Ã‚Â 
components	 Ã‚Â included	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â programmes	 Ã‚Â such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â Sampoerna	 Ã‚Â (ACDP	 Ã‚Â forthcoming)	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Undertake	 Ã‚Â  an	 Ã‚Â  international	 Ã‚Â  review	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  pre-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âservice	 Ã‚Â  teacher	 Ã‚Â  training	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia,	 Ã‚Â  reporting	 Ã‚Â 
against	 Ã‚Â international	 Ã‚Â benchmarks.	 Ã‚Â (OECD	 Ã‚Â 2015)	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
Promote	 Ã‚Â Continued	 Ã‚Â Professional	 Ã‚Â Development	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Develop	 Ã‚Â  systems	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  appraising	 Ã‚Â  teacher	 Ã‚Â  performance	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  link	 Ã‚Â  these	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  ongoing	 Ã‚Â  training	 Ã‚Â 
opportunities.	 Ã‚Â  Principals	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  supervisors	 Ã‚Â  can	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  trained	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  evaluate	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  provide	 Ã‚Â 
feedback.	 Ã‚Â (OECD	 Ã‚Â 2015)	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Develop	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â shared	 Ã‚Â understanding	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â what	 Ã‚Â constitutes	 Ã‚Â effective	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â what	 Ã‚Â it	 Ã‚Â looks	 Ã‚Â like	 Ã‚Â 
in	 Ã‚Â practice	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â provide	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â support	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â pressure	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â carry	 Ã‚Â it	 Ã‚Â out.	 Ã‚Â (OECD	 Ã‚Â 2015)	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
2. Pressure	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â  reforms	 Ã‚Â set	 Ã‚Â out	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 2005	 Ã‚Â Law,	 Ã‚Â especially	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â creation	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â professional	 Ã‚Â allowance	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â 
certified	 Ã‚Â teachers,	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â placed	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â continue	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â place	 Ã‚Â significant	 Ã‚Â pressure	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â 
budget.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 



	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â reforms	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â  largely	 Ã‚Â financed	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â  increases	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â government	 Ã‚Â  investment	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  fulfilment	 Ã‚Â  since	 Ã‚Â  2009	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  constitutional	 Ã‚Â  obligation	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  devote	 Ã‚Â  20	 Ã‚Â  percent	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
public	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Between	 Ã‚Â 2006	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 2010,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â overall	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â increased	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â real	 Ã‚Â terms	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â 47	 Ã‚Â percent	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â 
Rp	 Ã‚Â 66	 Ã‚Â trillion.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ There	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â substantial	 Ã‚Â trade-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âoffs	 Ã‚Â associated	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â increases	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â salary	 Ã‚Â spending	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â cost	 Ã‚Â 
of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  certification	 Ã‚Â  programme	 Ã‚Â  limits	 Ã‚Â  investments	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  other	 Ã‚Â  areas	 Ã‚Â  crucial	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  improving	 Ã‚Â 
educational	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â in-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âservice	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â training	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â incentive	 Ã‚Â systems.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â  24-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âperiod	 Ã‚Â  rule,	 Ã‚Â  which	 Ã‚Â  was	 Ã‚Â  meant	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  push	 Ã‚Â  surplus	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  out	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  profession	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â 
reduce	 Ã‚Â costs,	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â had	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â significant	 Ã‚Â impact	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â size	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â force.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â nine	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â minimum	 Ã‚Â staffing	 Ã‚Â norm	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â leading	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â there	 Ã‚Â being	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â oversupply	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â

Address	 Ã‚Â oversupply	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â reduce	 Ã‚Â student-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âteacher	 Ã‚Â ratios	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Improving	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  use	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  raising	 Ã‚Â  student-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âteacher	 Ã‚Â  ratios	 Ã‚Â  hold	 Ã‚Â  out	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  prospect	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Since	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â average	 Ã‚Â age	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  increasing	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 30%	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  teacher	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â  retiring	 Ã‚Â over	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â

Policy on PNS Teacher in Private Schools  

 

 

The Context of PNS Teachers in Private Schools 

 

Equitable distribution of qualified teachers is a complex issue in IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vast educational system where private 

schools play a significant role in educational provision, particularly in remote rural areas. Historically, most formal 

education was provided primarily by private faith-based organizations. To this day private Islamic, Protestant, and 

Catholic schools offer basic and secondary education to a significant proportion of students in some districts. 

Typically, these schools serve the most disadvantaged students. For example, according to the ACDP Situational 

Analysis Report for Sumba, NTT approximately 41% out of more than 151,000 primary students on that island are 

enrolled in faith-based private schools; in the Sumba Barat Daya district the proportion of students in non-

government schools reaches 50%.

Recognizing the importance of private provision in IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s education system, the Government has sought to 

equalize the quality of private and public education through several policy actions, including the BOS and placing PNS 

teachers in private schools, including private madrasah and pesantren. These PNS teachers are called Ã¢â‚¬Å“guru PNS yang 

dipekerjakanÃ¢â‚¬Â or DPK teachers. In the four districts of Sumba, on average more than 40% of teachers in private 

schools are DPK teachers and in Central Sumba district alone, DPK teachers make up half of the teachers.  The 

proportion of PNS and non-PNS teachers in public and private schools varies by district.  In the Sumba districts overall, 

45% of teachers in government schools are PNS and 40% of teachers in private schools are PNS (see Figure 1).

The Issue of PNS Teacher Pull-Out  

 

In mid-January of 2017 the Government made a public statement that will affect DPK teachers. The statement 

described the GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intention to reinforce Government Regulation No. 53/2010 strictly.  This regulation 

restricts PNS to serve in government entities exclusively. When applied to teachers, the impact would be to withdraw 

PNS teachers from private schools and deploy them to government schools instead.

 ACDP, 2016. Strategies for Improving Basic Education School/Madrasah Effectiveness in Sumba, NTT.  Volume 1: Comprehensiveness Situation 

Analysis. p. 7. 



 

 

The mandate will have a devastating impact on students in private primary and secondary schools and madrasahs, 

especially those in disadvantaged areas.  

 

Re-deploying DPK teachers to government schools will adversely affect especially the 3T areas (predominantly 

outermost, isolated, underdeveloped areas), as may be demonstrated by the case of Central Sumba where the 

mandate would translate to the district losing half of the teachers in their private schools in the proposed reallocation 

of PNS teachers to government schools in Central Sumba or elsewhere. 

 

Districts have pulled PNS teachers out of private schools in the past. In February 2016, the government of Pekalongan 

district Central Java withdrew DPK teachers wholesale, an action that received harsh criticism from the Forum for 

Private Education Institutions (Badan Musyawarah Perguruan Swasta or BMPS)
2
. Despite joint ministerial decrees in 

2014 and a letter from the Minister of Education formalizing and supporting the placement of PNS teachers in private 

schools in mid-2016, the pull-out issue is resurfacing. In response to a 2017 directive from MenPAN-RB on the 

withdrawal of DPK teachers, the Vice Regent of Sumba Timur district warned the public that the PNS teacher pull-out 

will again translate into a form of social neglect of school-aged children in remote areas
3
. 

 

This most recent public statement directing PNS teachers to return to government schools is the latest iteration of 

similar statements in a string of central and local governmentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ inconsistencies on messages to the public regarding 

DPK teachers. It signals perhaps an ongoing policy conversation and debate over how to interpret regulatory 

frameworks governing the distribution of PNS teachers, and what sectoral adjustments are needed. There are 

inconsistencies in policies emanating from different levels in the hierarchy of legal products Ã¢â‚¬â€government regulations 

or Peraturan Pemerintah, Laws or Undang-Undang, and Ministerial Decrees or Peraturan Menteri. Table 1 lists the 

various policy directions and public statements made in the past 8 years that have swung between supporting or 

opposing DPK teachers serving in private schools.  

 

The timeline in table 1 illustrates the standpoints of agencies around the issue of DPK.  The regulations, decrees, and 

public statements depicted in the table swing back and forth between support for deploying PNS teachers to private 

schools and support for withdrawing them in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“ping-pongingÃ¢â‚¬Â manner.  It gives the impression that Ministries are 

pulling in different direction on this issue. This pattern has created confusion at the district level that is exacerbated 

by rumors, misinterpretation of public statements, and a tendency to take public statements as new regulations.  

 

There is a need for clarity on the placement of PNS teachers in private schools at the policy, legal, and regulatory 

levels. More importantly, there is a need for careful consideration regarding how the legal and regulatory framework 

pertaining to PNS teacher management and distribution will be interpreted at the local level.  The risk is that rigid 

application of overall PNS management policies to DPK teachers will doubly disadvantage children in rural remote 

areas.   Those children are already disadvantaged simply by residing in resource poor areas. To withdraw qualified 

teachers from their schools would further deprive them of one resource that could help them to improve their lives 

now and in the future.

KOPI DARAT 
Kongkow Pendidikan: Diskusi Ahli dan Tukar Pendapat 

8 March  2017 
 

Topic #31 
 
Has Higher Education Made Themselves Relevant to National Economic Planning? 
 

 
Until 2018, it is projected that the demand of high-level skilled workers in Indonesia will grow rapidly in terms 
of quantity and quality. An ACDP study about the impact of education on the strategy and needs of IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 
industry and economy found that 69% of companies involved in the study plan to hire more workers within 
this period.  
 
The study, titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Linking the National Plans for Acceleration and Expansion of Economic Development to 
Programming in the Education SectorÃ¢â‚¬Â showed that the demand for these skilled workers will increase the 
fastest in the areas of finance, transportation and communication. Specifically, the demand will be for 
technicians, engineers and supervisory and senior management personnel. To a lesser degree, there will also 
be a need for research assistants, personnel managers, machinists and metal fabricators. The study uses 
secondary data, focus group discussion and a survey of 489 firms, 282 vocational secondary schools (SMK), 54 
vocational training centres (BLK), 896 universities and research institutions, and 83 government bodies across 
the different regions of Indonesia.   
 
Capacity of the Higher Education to Provide Skilled Workforce 
 
The higher education capacity to provide the skilled workers needed by the industry can be measured in terms 
of quantity and quality. Quantitatively, the higher education capacity in Indonesia in providing the required 
skilled workers was deemed to be sufficient. However, the quality of higher education graduates is still 
considered not meeting the standards and the requirements of employers, particularly in technical capabilities, 
English skills, and soft skills such as working in groups, critical thinking and innovation capabilities. 
 
The difference between graduatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ quality and qualification standards also vary between institutions and 
across regions. Large higher education institutions, which are mostly located in Java, were shown to have better 
accreditation records than smaller ones. While regions such as Papua, Nusa Tenggara and Kalimantan had no 
Category A accreditations in either public or private institutions. Private institutions, although few of them are 
exceedingly good, relatively perform lower than public ones in terms of national accreditation. The percentage 
of private institutions accredited in Category C, is twice than that of public institutions. 
 
The disparity in the accreditation of higher education institutions eventually results in the disparity of its 
graduates. According to the ACDP study, approximately 40% of graduates in Papua are unemployed. Such is 
also the case of 20% graduates in specific programs in Kalimantan and Nusa Tenggara. The disparity in quality 
is not only found between regions, but also between institutions. University graduates with similar 
qualifications often have acquired considerably different sets of skills and knowledge. Due to this disparity, 
employers are unable to trust qualifications of graduates and use informal sources of recruitment which are 
not completely reliable and relevant. 
 
 



 

 	
	

 
Research and Innovation Capacity 
 
Well-developed research, development and innovation systems are important components in economic 
growth. Yet, Indonesia would still need to develop its capacity in this area as it is still lagging behind from its 
neighbouring countries in terms of both the quality and quantity of research, including publications and 
patents, qualification of faculties and research financing. To respond to the problem of research financing, an 
independent body called the Indonesian Science Fund (ISF) was created to raise and channel fund from the 
government and non-government sources to support scientific research. 
 
Research is one of the main tasks of higher education, as stipulated in the Law No. 12 Year 2012 on Higher 
Education. The ACDP study recommended government to support up to 3-4 higher education institutions to 
develop their research capacities to be world class institutions. A similar recommendation came from the 
World Bank which suggested investing selectively but substantially in a relatively small number of institutions 
in order to boost their research capacity in a way that might have spin-offs for other institutions.  
 
In addition, the ACDP study also recommended that every region in Indonesia should have at least one research 
university that aims to be of national significance, specialising in the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comparative advantage. The 
research must also be encouraged by innovation and entrepreneurship in order to exploit discoveries made 
from the research. The Indonesian Science Fund can support this by working with relevant stakeholders in the 
national and local level, particularly if the fund was based on the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top priorities and main 
programs. The National Research Masterplan for 2017-2045 which will be established as the Presidential 
Regulation could also be used as reference. 
 
Developing Linkages to the Industry  
 
In its National Medium Term Development Plan (RPJMN) for 2015-2019, the Indonesian Government proposes 
a number of strategies to link industry and education and improve collection, analysis and dissemination of 
labour market information. These strategies include developing curriculum that is aligned with employment 
needs and based on input from business and industry while also aligning curriculum development programs 
and vocational skills according to the main economic activity and labour market needs in the district/city. The  
 
Ministry of Manpower further proposes strategies to facilitate the functioning of the labour market through 
means such as integrating the Labour Market Information (LMI) system to respond to information queries from 
companies, training providers, job seekers and policy makers. 
 
The relevance and quality of higher education graduates could be improved through curriculum development 
and training programs for students, as well as providing opportunities for students to learn about working 
environment through counselling and internship or apprenticeship programs. Moreover, the industry could 
also use the knowledge and facility of higher education institutions to develop their staff capacity. However, 
currently, only 7% of employers surveyed are involved in curriculum development, 12% use institutions for 
staff training, 7% enter into joint research projects and 7% have staff arranged as instructors. More than half 
(about 60%) of employers interviewed do not provide internships for graduates. 
 
 
 
 



 

 	
	

An alternative way to develop the relevance of higher education institutions with the industry is by using the 
LMI. According to experience and practice of developed countries, the underlying features of an effective LMI 
would include: timely, accurate and relevant data; effective data analysis and interpretation; easy access of 
users through various outlets; as well as connectors with comprehensive knowledge of the labour market. 
Government surveys show that the use of labour market information (LMI) is very limited and fragmented in 
Indonesia, and that it is particularly weak at the district/local level. The data which was administratively 
gathered from the local employers cannot represent the population of the workforce and data consistency 
from business companies are relatively weak. In addition, the education sector is yet to use the LMI system 
optimally. 
 

 
Recommended Policy Options  
 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Support to 3-4 universities in the country to develop their research capability to be world class 
institutions  

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Investing selectively but substantially in a relatively small number of institutions in order to 
boost their research capacity in a way that might have spin-offs for other institutions  

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ At least one research university in each region to be developed, and aimed to be of national 
significance, specialising in certain research topics according to local potentials.  

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Indonesian Science Fund to work with the relevant national, regional and provincial authorities 
to support planning and strategic investment, and to do review on the strengths of research.  

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ All institutions to ensure their programs are relevant with the industry and national economy 
priorities by considering input/information from the curriculum advisory committee and 
representatives of industry. 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Network between employers, the government and higher education institutions to be better 
established to ensure that industry provides the right signal and involve students at earlier stage 
into the world of industry. On other side, higher education institutions are suggested to prepare 
their students appropriately prior to entering professional industries.

KOPI DARAT 

Kongkow Pendidikan: Diskusi Ahli dan Tukar Pendapat 
26 April 2017 

 

Topik #32 
 
Weaving Diversity through Education 
 

 
The value of diversity is one of the values incorporated in President Joko WidodoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s National Priority Agenda 
(Nawacita) and it is brought forward in the 9th Agenda or Cita that states Ã¢â‚¬Å“Upholding diversity and strengthening 
social restoration through policies, reinforcing education of diversity and creating intercommunity forums.Ã¢â‚¬Â Based on 
this Cita, the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) has programmed an education on diversity through civic 
education at schools in its Strategic Plan (Renstra) 2015-2019. The Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA) has also 
established policies that enforce three main aspects or having a main focus on Islamic Education, including education 
of peaceful cultural values through Islamic Religious Education.  
 
The purpose of the 9th Cita and policies of both ministries have empirical basis and evidences. A number of studies 
which were conducted by a number of research organizations revealed that intolerance is not only found amongst the 
general public, but also found within the realm of education and youth. A survey on Inter-Religious Harmony (KUB) 
Index in 2016 conducted by MoRAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Center of Research and Development on Religious Life showed that the index of 
cooperation, a main component of KUB Index, is lower than the other two main components which are tolerance and 
equality. The survey also showed that communities that live in cities with high religious diversity, higher education or 
income level tend to possess a higher level of inter-religious cooperation than their counterparts. 
 
A survey conducted by SETARA Institute for Democracy and Peace (SIDP) on students of public senior secondary 
schools (SMU) in Jakarta and Bandung in 2015 showed that as much as 8.5% students agreed that the Pancasila should 
be replaced by religious foundations and 9.8% students support the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq (ISIS) movement. 
Although the number of percentages are less than 10%, this still remains a concern considering that public schools are 
more likely to emphasize on patriotic education.  
 
The above data is also supported by the results of Saiful Mujani Research Consulting (SMRC) survey on December 
2015 which analyzed the publicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opinion on ISIS and its relation to terrorism in Indonesia. The survey found as many 
as 4% participants in the 22-25 yearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ age group and 5% participants who are still studying sympathized and agreed 
with ISIS. This indicated that the support for ISIS is more likely to come from the youth group.  
 
Diversity Education in Educational Institutions  
 
Although a number of policies that strengthen values of tolerance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ particularly in educational institutions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ have 
already been established, they have not been fully implemented in practice. To address this issue, the Center of Policy 
Research on Education and Culture (Puslitjakdikbud) in MoEC conducted a study to identify the issue of intolerance 
and suggest ways to optimize the implementation of Diversity Education in educational institutions. The study is 
conducted using a qualitative approach in Singkawang City (West Kalimantan Province) and Salatiga City (Central Java 
Province). Both cities have diverse communities, in terms of religion, ethnicity and culture.  
 
The results of the study showed that the barriers of Diversity Education can be categorized into three groups: (1) 
policies; (2) attitude and behavior of school community (i.e. teachers, principals, education personnel, students, 
parents, local community and governments, and other relevant stakeholders); and (3) resources. The policies being 
discussed here include school policies and local government policies.  
 
 
 
 



 

 	
	

 
 
Several local governments are thought as lacking initiatives in implementing diversity programs at schools and schools 
are thought as putting too much emphasis on developing the cognitive domain at the cost of limiting the development 
of other domains of learning. In addition, there are still some schools that have not provided students with the 
religious education based on the studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ beliefs.  
 
The attitude and behavior of school community are shaped by either their former education background or their 
environment which may not encourage integration. To illustrate, the tendency to choose friends from the same or 
similar ethnic group is encouraged by the different ethnic groupsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ habit to use their own ethnic language in daily lives.  
Limited resources, in terms of finance and facilities, are also considered as one of the barriers because they limit 
schools in implementing diversity programs which has been previously planned.  

 
Results from the studyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s questionnaire showed that 60% students thought that it was easy to be friends with students 
from other ethnic groups. On the other hand, about 28% students in Singkawang still thought it was easier to make 
friends with students from the same ethnic group. In views of leadership position, the majority of students did not 
agree that the student bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leader should come from the majority group. However, more than 40% of students 
were in doubt or would agree that ethnic and religion would be their main consideration in choosing a leader for the 
public.  
 
Teaching Values of Tolerance through Religious Education 
 
SIDP also revealed that were about 31% of religious education materials that are against values of diversity. This 
finding is confirmed by the results of evaluation and audit on Islamic Religious Education (PAI) textbooks, which has 
been conducted regularly since 2006 by the Center of Research and Development (Puslitbang) on Religious Lecture, 
Religious Properties and Organization Management of Research and Development Agency in MoRA. The evaluation 
and audit include aspects of textbook content, presentation of textbooks, linguistics and graphics.  
 
The regular evaluation and audit found that there are many mistakes and wrong information in PAI textbooks that are 
currently circulated. As an example, one book contains some narrative that lean on radicalism and conflict resolution 
through violence. Another case had emerged in the early 2015, when a PAI and Character Education textbook in East 
Java contained a sentence saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“people who do not worship Allah are non-Moslems and infidels are allowed to be 
killedÃ¢â‚¬Â. Following this incident, a MoRA official stated that all PAI books should be reviewed first by MoRA before they 
are printed and published. 
 
However, institutionally, MoRA is not involved in PAI textbook writing for schools, which falls under the responsibility 
of the Center of Curriculum and Textbook (Puskurbuk) in MoEC. At the moment, there has not been an organization 
that specifically checks published PAI textbooks. Also, there is still yet a regulation that comprehensively regulates the 
assessment and audit of textbooks aside from MoRAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ministerial Decision No. 437 Year 2001 which regulates the use 
of materials from Al-Quran in textbooks. 
 
In 2016, the evaluation and audit of PAI textbooks were conducted on approximately 150 books, which included 
textbooks for schools and madrasahs at all school grade. The highest number of mistakes was found on transliteration 
of ayat (Quranic verses) and ahadith (the words, actions or habits of the Islamic prophet Muhammad). This could 
affect the meaning of the ayat and ahadith if they are not translated properly and may cause students to 
misunderstand their meaning. In addition, there are mistakes in quoting and writing the ahadith. Several ahadith that 
were used provided weak arguments or evidence and therefore cannot be considered as solid legal grounds. In other 
cases, the ahadith did not match with the content being discussed in the textbooks.  
 
According to an ACDP study which was commissioned by the Directorate of Islamic Education in MoRA, formal Islamic 
Religious Education has an important role in promoting the culture and values of tolerance and peace.  
 
 
 
 



 

 	
	

 
 
This study states that there have been many values and principles promoting peace embedded in the curriculum. 
However, it needs better implementation. The study also recommends that formal Islamic Religious Education can be 
taught to curb violence.  
 
Recommendation 
 
The study by Puslitjakdikbud in MoEC based their recommendations on existing good practices in schools. From those 
good practices, they concluded that affirmative school policies and the role of educator can contribute to improving 
the diversity at schools. Policy options recommended by the study include schools to ensure students of different 
ethnic groups, religions and groups to mingle, and teachers and principals to improve their role in maintaining 
tolerance through teacher forums (KKG and MGMP) and principal forums (K3S and MKKS). The study on KUB Index 
suggested another option, which is to mainstream the issue of inter-religious community cooperation into the intra-
curricular and extracurricular of educational institutions.  
 
The local governments are also advised to support school and the publicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s activities that encourage citizens from 
different religions and cultural groups to mingle. The study on KUB Index also recommended the local governments to 
develop programs and activities that allow citizens to know more of pluralism and to interact with believers of 
different religions.  
 
To assure the quality of current PAI textbooks, the study from MoRA suggested for cooperation between the 
government, writers, publishers and even assessors in developing, evaluating and following up the results from PAI 
textbooks evaluation and audit. However, its recommendation does not stop at only the process of evaluation and 
audit for PAI textbooks, but also urged for a comprehensive regulation on evaluation and audit of all textbooks 
including the mechanisms, standards, and involvement of relevant institutions and stakeholders.  
 
To ensure the implementation of the aforementioned regulation, the government needs to set the standards of 
textbook evaluators and also include experts on the subjects. Meanwhile, publishers should withdraw textbooks with 
mistakes and stop printing such textbooks. Furthermore, all textbooks should be passed evaluation of textbook 
assessors before publishing.

Issues	 Ã‚Â :	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

Indonesia	 Ã‚Â needs	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â right	 Ã‚Â resources	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â help	 Ã‚Â graduates	 Ã‚Â gain	 Ã‚Â 21st	 Ã‚Â century	 Ã‚Â skills.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

Opportunities	 Ã‚Â  Challenges	 Ã‚Â 

The	 Ã‚Â potential	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â guide	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â 21st	 Ã‚Â 
century	 Ã‚Â skills	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â well	 Ã‚Â designed	 Ã‚Â curriculum.	 Ã‚Â 

The	 Ã‚Â majority	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â teachers,	 Ã‚Â especially	 Ã‚Â those	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â small	 Ã‚Â 
schools	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â rural	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â remote	 Ã‚Â areas	 Ã‚Â who	 Ã‚Â donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â 

full	 Ã‚Â qualifications,	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â extreme	 Ã‚Â difficulty	 Ã‚Â 
implementing	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â curriculum.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 

Skills	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  critical	 Ã‚Â  thinking	 Ã‚Â  skills,	 Ã‚Â  problem	 Ã‚Â  solving	 Ã‚Â 
skills	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  higher	 Ã‚Â  order	 Ã‚Â  thinking	 Ã‚Â  skills	 Ã‚Â  can	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  taught	 Ã‚Â 
within	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â curriculum	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
1. New	 Ã‚Â classroom	 Ã‚Â practices.	 Ã‚Â 

New	 Ã‚Â classroom	 Ã‚Â practices	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â meant	 Ã‚Â to:	 Ã‚Â 
a. Foster	 Ã‚Â independent	 Ã‚Â learning,	 Ã‚Â questioning,	 Ã‚Â 

processing	 Ã‚Â judgment	 Ã‚Â making,	 Ã‚Â observation,	 Ã‚Â 
communicating	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â creating;	 Ã‚Â 

b. Utilize	 Ã‚Â 21st	 Ã‚Â century	 Ã‚Â skills	 Ã‚Â such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â problem	 Ã‚Â 
solving,	 Ã‚Â collaborating	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â teamwork;	 Ã‚Â 

c. Change	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â role	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â being	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 
source	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â information	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â being	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â manager	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
a	 Ã‚Â learning	 Ã‚Â process	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â occurs	 Ã‚Â inside	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
outside	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â classroom.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
2. New	 Ã‚Â ways	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â assessing	 Ã‚Â studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â learning	 Ã‚Â 

-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â Assessment	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â change	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â help	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â develop	 Ã‚Â 
21st	 Ã‚Â century	 Ã‚Â learning	 Ã‚Â goals.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â Instead	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â testing	 Ã‚Â memorized	 Ã‚Â knowledge	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
competency,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â assessment	 Ã‚Â envisions	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â 
teachers	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â assess	 Ã‚Â studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â attitudes	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â skills	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â knowledge	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â well	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â learning	 Ã‚Â process	 Ã‚Â 
itself,	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â using	 Ã‚Â student	 Ã‚Â portfolios.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â Teachers	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â meant	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â assess	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â 
self-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âassessment,	 Ã‚Â project	 Ã‚Â assessment,	 Ã‚Â daily	 Ã‚Â tests	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â assignments	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â mid	 Ã‚Â year	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â final	 Ã‚Â tests.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

3. Integration	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â information	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Communications	 Ã‚Â 
Technology	 Ã‚Â (ICT)	 Ã‚Â into	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â subjects.	 Ã‚Â 
ICT	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  important	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  developing	 Ã‚Â  21st	 Ã‚Â  century	 Ã‚Â  skills	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â meant	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â integrated	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â subjects.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 

1. Teachers	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â yet	 Ã‚Â ready	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â implement	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 21st	 Ã‚Â 
Century	 Ã‚Â learning	 Ã‚Â approach	 Ã‚Â 
This	 Ã‚Â  classroom	 Ã‚Â  practices	 Ã‚Â  require	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â 
firmly	 Ã‚Â  established	 Ã‚Â  habits	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  providing	 Ã‚Â  focused	 Ã‚Â 
leadership,	 Ã‚Â  support	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  supervision.	 Ã‚Â  Currently,	 Ã‚Â 
teachers	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â habit	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â this	 Ã‚Â type	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â teaching.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

2. Teachers	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â found	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â assessment	 Ã‚Â methods	 Ã‚Â 
challenging.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
To	 Ã‚Â  implement	 Ã‚Â  new	 Ã‚Â  assessment	 Ã‚Â  methods,	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â 
need	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  deep	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  underpinning	 Ã‚Â  principles	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â 
standards	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  making	 Ã‚Â  judgments.	 Ã‚Â  Internalizing	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
criteria	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  make	 Ã‚Â  necessary	 Ã‚Â  judgments	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  complex	 Ã‚Â 
task	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â take	 Ã‚Â time	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â develop.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 

3. Teachers	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â prepared	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â teach	 Ã‚Â 21st	 Ã‚Â century	 Ã‚Â skills	 Ã‚Â 
to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â expanding	 Ã‚Â group	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â brought	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â 12-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â
year	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â programme.	 Ã‚Â There	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â no	 Ã‚Â provisions	 Ã‚Â 
or	 Ã‚Â special	 Ã‚Â attention	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â ways	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â prepared	 Ã‚Â 
to	 Ã‚Â deliver	 Ã‚Â these	 Ã‚Â skills	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â diverse	 Ã‚Â group	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â individuals	 Ã‚Â 
of	 Ã‚Â different	 Ã‚Â ages	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â different	 Ã‚Â learning	 Ã‚Â needs.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

4. Too	 Ã‚Â short	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â time	 Ã‚Â frame	 Ã‚Â provided	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â training	 Ã‚Â 
teachers.	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â  period	 Ã‚Â  set	 Ã‚Â  aside	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  train	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  new	 Ã‚Â 
curriculum	 Ã‚Â  did	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  allow	 Ã‚Â  them	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  form	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  habits	 Ã‚Â 
needed	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  implement	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  new	 Ã‚Â  classroom	 Ã‚Â  practices.	 Ã‚Â 
Changing	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â understanding	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â practices	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â 
in	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  short	 Ã‚Â  amount	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  time.	 Ã‚Â  There	 Ã‚Â  was	 Ã‚Â  also	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â 
enough	 Ã‚Â  time	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  establish	 Ã‚Â  commitment	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  key	 Ã‚Â 
stakeholders	 Ã‚Â like	 Ã‚Â parents,	 Ã‚Â teachers,	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â officials	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â elected	 Ã‚Â representatives.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 

5. Not	 Ã‚Â enough	 Ã‚Â time	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â provide	 Ã‚Â high	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â training	 Ã‚Â 
a. The	 Ã‚Â  cascade	 Ã‚Â model,	 Ã‚Â  which	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  intended	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  used	 Ã‚Â 

for	 Ã‚Â  training	 Ã‚Â  teachers,	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  suitable	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  changing	 Ã‚Â 
teachersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â behavior	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â classroom;	 Ã‚Â 

b. The	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  teacher	 Ã‚Â  preparation	 Ã‚Â  programs	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â 
already	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  considered	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  weak	 Ã‚Â  point	 Ã‚Â  due	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
increase	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â enrolments	 Ã‚Â following	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â rise	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â 
salaries.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

6. Lack	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â resources	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â skills	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â implement	 Ã‚Â ICT.	 Ã‚Â 
Schools	 Ã‚Â  do	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  resources	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  implement	 Ã‚Â  ICT	 Ã‚Â 
into	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â  subjects	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  lack	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  skills	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â 
knowledge	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â teach	 Ã‚Â their	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â about	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â effective	 Ã‚Â 
use	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  ICT	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â how	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â use	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â enable	 Ã‚Â creativity	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
promote	 Ã‚Â learning.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 



 
	 Ã‚Â 

 
 

Policy	 Ã‚Â Options	 Ã‚Â :	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 

1. Provide	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  with	 Ã‚Â  opportunities	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  understand	 Ã‚Â  assessment	 Ã‚Â  methods.	 Ã‚Â  This	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  gained	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  debating	 Ã‚Â 
education	 Ã‚Â theory	 Ã‚Â related	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â assessment	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â comparing	 Ã‚Â their	 Ã‚Â judgments	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â those	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â teachers;	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

2. Support	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  implementing	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  new	 Ã‚Â  curriculum.	 Ã‚Â  This	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  done	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  providing	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  job	 Ã‚Â  learning	 Ã‚Â 
opportunities	 Ã‚Â using	 Ã‚Â resources	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â Internet,	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â networks	 Ã‚Â created	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â social	 Ã‚Â media	 Ã‚Â platforms,	 Ã‚Â use	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
mobile	 Ã‚Â phone	 Ã‚Â technology	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â well	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â distance	 Ã‚Â learning;	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

3. Train	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  teach	 Ã‚Â  both	 Ã‚Â  academic	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  practical	 Ã‚Â  subjects	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  strongly	 Ã‚Â  emphasize	 Ã‚Â  21st	 Ã‚Â  century	 Ã‚Â  skills	 Ã‚Â 
instead	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â divide	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â into	 Ã‚Â different	 Ã‚Â tracks	 Ã‚Â such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â SMA	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â SMK.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

4. Designing	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â strict	 Ã‚Â selection	 Ã‚Â procedure	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â candidates	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â aligned	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â needs	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 21st	 Ã‚Â century	 Ã‚Â 
skills	 Ã‚Â before	 Ã‚Â they	 Ã‚Â enter	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â training	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â improve	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â efficiency	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â effectiveness	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â pre-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âservice	 Ã‚Â training.	 Ã‚Â

	 Ã‚Â 
Background	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
In	 Ã‚Â  service	 Ã‚Â  training,	 Ã‚Â  also	 Ã‚Â  called	 Ã‚Â Continuing	 Ã‚Â Professional	 Ã‚Â Development	 Ã‚Â  (CPD),	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  crucial	 Ã‚Â  part	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  any	 Ã‚Â 
teacher	 Ã‚Â management	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â development	 Ã‚Â system.	 Ã‚Â CPD	 Ã‚Â helps	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â  improve	 Ã‚Â existing	 Ã‚Â practices	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
meet	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â demands.	 Ã‚Â This	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â  important	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â  it	 Ã‚Â  improves	 Ã‚Â  its	 Ã‚Â curriculum	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â aims	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â 
improve	 Ã‚Â  student	 Ã‚Â  performance	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  international	 Ã‚Â  tests,	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  which	 Ã‚Â  require	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  teachers.	 Ã‚Â  What	 Ã‚Â 
teachers	 Ã‚Â know	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â do	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â class	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â biggest	 Ã‚Â determining	 Ã‚Â factor	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â successful	 Ã‚Â  implementation	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â curriculum.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â 2005	 Ã‚Â TeacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â Law	 Ã‚Â was	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â most	 Ã‚Â significant	 Ã‚Â measure	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â raise	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â quality.	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â  Law	 Ã‚Â  requires	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â must	 Ã‚Â  obtain	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  four-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyear	 Ã‚Â  degree	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â pass	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  formal	 Ã‚Â  certification	 Ã‚Â 
process.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â  Law	 Ã‚Â  targeted	 Ã‚Â  aspiring	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  well	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  older	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  who	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  already	 Ã‚Â  teaching.	 Ã‚Â 
When	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Law	 Ã‚Â  was	 Ã‚Â  passed,	 Ã‚Â  65%	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â  2.7	 Ã‚Â  million	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  did	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  meet	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  minimum	 Ã‚Â 
academic	 Ã‚Â requirements.	 Ã‚Â The	 Ã‚Â TeacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â Law	 Ã‚Â raised	 Ã‚Â important	 Ã‚Â questions	 Ã‚Â related	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â CPD.	 Ã‚Â For	 Ã‚Â example,	 Ã‚Â 
how	 Ã‚Â should	 Ã‚Â CPD	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â linked	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â promotion	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â salary	 Ã‚Â increments?1	 Ã‚Â

Ministerial	 Ã‚Â Decree	 Ã‚Â No.	 Ã‚Â 16	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 2007,	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â came	 Ã‚Â into	 Ã‚Â place	 Ã‚Â after	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â enactment	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â TeacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â Law,	 Ã‚Â 
specifies	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  academic	 Ã‚Â  qualification	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  competency	 Ã‚Â  standards	 Ã‚Â  needed	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â  teachers.	 Ã‚Â 
After	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â decree	 Ã‚Â became	 Ã‚Â effective,	 Ã‚Â IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â Ministry	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Culture,	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â support	 Ã‚Â 
of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â World	 Ã‚Â Bank,	 Ã‚Â started	 Ã‚Â developing	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â CPD	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â Performance	 Ã‚Â Appraisal	 Ã‚Â system	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â based	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â 
competency	 Ã‚Â  standards.2	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â  currently	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  33	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  assurance	 Ã‚Â  agencies	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  12	 Ã‚Â  national	 Ã‚Â 
subject	 Ã‚Â training	 Ã‚Â centers	 Ã‚Â responsible	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â in-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âservice	 Ã‚Â training.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
However,	 Ã‚Â  CPD	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â  still	 Ã‚Â  requires	 Ã‚Â  improvement.	 Ã‚Â  A	 Ã‚Â  recent	 Ã‚Â  review	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â 
revealed	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â most	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â do	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â experience	 Ã‚Â regular	 Ã‚Â ongoing	 Ã‚Â professional	 Ã‚Â development	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â there	 Ã‚Â 
is	 Ã‚Â  very	 Ã‚Â  little	 Ã‚Â  on-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âthe-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âjob	 Ã‚Â  coaching	 Ã‚Â  provided	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  external	 Ã‚Â  facilitators,	 Ã‚Â  principals,	 Ã‚Â  supervisors	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â 
experienced	 Ã‚Â teachers.3	 Ã‚Â 

Issue:	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
CPD	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â haphazard	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â remains	 Ã‚Â inconsistent.4	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â currently	 Ã‚Â provides	 Ã‚Â CPD	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â 
a	 Ã‚Â cascade	 Ã‚Â function,	 Ã‚Â whereby	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â trained	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â then	 Ã‚Â go	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â trains	 Ã‚Â others.	 Ã‚Â Indonesia	 Ã‚Â could	 Ã‚Â 
supplement	 Ã‚Â this	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â providing	 Ã‚Â CPD	 Ã‚Â linked	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â some	 Ã‚Â kind	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â lon	 Ã‚Â ger	 Ã‚Â term	 Ã‚Â qualification	 Ã‚Â process	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â 
ongoing,	 Ã‚Â school-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âbased	 Ã‚Â training	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â feedback	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â follow-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âup	 Ã‚Â support.5	 Ã‚Â Most	 Ã‚Â research	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â effective	 Ã‚Â 
CPD	 Ã‚Â emphasizes	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â importance	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â longer-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âterm,	 Ã‚Â team	 Ã‚Â based	 Ã‚Â activities.6	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â A	 Ã‚Â few	 Ã‚Â ways	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â improving	 Ã‚Â 
CPD	 Ã‚Â include	 Ã‚Â identifying	 Ã‚Â best	 Ã‚Â practices,	 Ã‚Â introducing	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â strengthening	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â working	 Ã‚Â groups,	 Ã‚Â 
assessment	 Ã‚Â systems	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â pay-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âby-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âperformance	 Ã‚Â schemes.	 Ã‚Â

Challenges	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â reforming	 Ã‚Â CPD	 Ã‚Â methods:	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
1. Teacher	 Ã‚Â working	 Ã‚Â groups	 Ã‚Â (KKGs	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â MGMPs)	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â 

been	 Ã‚Â recognized	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“the	 Ã‚Â most	 Ã‚Â viable	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â accessible	 Ã‚Â 
avenue	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â most	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â receive	 Ã‚Â continuing	 Ã‚Â 
professional	 Ã‚Â developmentÃ¢â‚¬Â	 Ã‚Â (Ministry	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â Culture	 Ã‚Â 2011a).	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
a. They	 Ã‚Â provide	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â forum	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â discuss	 Ã‚Â 

and	 Ã‚Â work	 Ã‚Â cooperatively	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â developing	 Ã‚Â 
curriculum,	 Ã‚Â lesson	 Ã‚Â plans,	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â practices	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â issues	 Ã‚Â like	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â 
special	 Ã‚Â needs	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â mother	 Ã‚Â tongue.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

b. They	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â place	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â over	 Ã‚Â 20	 Ã‚Â years	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â 
Indonesia	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â preforming	 Ã‚Â effectively	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
are	 Ã‚Â expanding	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â reach,	 Ã‚Â membership	 Ã‚Â (despite	 Ã‚Â 
not	 Ã‚Â being	 Ã‚Â related	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â salary	 Ã‚Â increases)	 Ã‚Â 
relevance	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â improvement	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â 
cognitive	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â pedagogical	 Ã‚Â abilities.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
2. Teacher	 Ã‚Â appraisal	 Ã‚Â systems	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â linked	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â 

progression	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â promotion	 Ã‚Â allow	 Ã‚Â principals	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â 
supervisors	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â work	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â assess	 Ã‚Â 
personal	 Ã‚Â goals,	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â teacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â professional	 Ã‚Â knowledge	 Ã‚Â

and	 Ã‚Â professional	 Ã‚Â values	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â personal	 Ã‚Â commitment.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
3. Bonus	 Ã‚Â payment	 Ã‚Â schemes,	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â pay-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âfor-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âperformance	 Ã‚Â 

schemes	 Ã‚Â add	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â salaries	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â ways	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â 
conditional	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â performance.	 Ã‚Â Individual	 Ã‚Â teacher	 Ã‚Â 
incentives	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â work	 Ã‚Â better	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â group	 Ã‚Â incentives	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â 
unconditional	 Ã‚Â block	 Ã‚Â grants	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â schools.	 Ã‚Â Performance	 Ã‚Â 
can	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â measured	 Ã‚Â based	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â inputs	 Ã‚Â such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â 
absenteeism	 Ã‚Â levels	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â outputs	 Ã‚Â such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â learning	 Ã‚Â 
gains.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
1. The	 Ã‚Â expectation	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â certified	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â would	 Ã‚Â 

use	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â portion	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â their	 Ã‚Â new	 Ã‚Â allowance	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â 
continuing	 Ã‚Â professional	 Ã‚Â development	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â rarely	 Ã‚Â

	 Ã‚Â 
3. Implementing	 Ã‚Â merit	 Ã‚Â pay	 Ã‚Â schemes	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â 

has	 Ã‚Â shown	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â seldom	 Ã‚Â last	 Ã‚Â longer	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â five	 Ã‚Â years,	 Ã‚Â 
lead	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â dysfunctional	 Ã‚Â behavior	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â may	 Ã‚Â 
focus	 Ã‚Â only	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â tasks	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â rewarded	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â pay	 Ã‚Â 
instead	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â valuable	 Ã‚Â tasks	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â disrupt	 Ã‚Â 
teacher	 Ã‚Â collegiality	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â introducing	 Ã‚Â competition.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
Policy	 Ã‚Â options:	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

1. Improve	 Ã‚Â cascade	 Ã‚Â training	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â identifying	 Ã‚Â good	 Ã‚Â practices	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â introducing	 Ã‚Â other	 Ã‚Â means	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â effective	 Ã‚Â 
training	 Ã‚Â linked	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â longer-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âterm	 Ã‚Â qualification	 Ã‚Â process;	 Ã‚Â 

2. Increase	 Ã‚Â opportunities	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â  recognition	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â collaborate	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â colleagues	 Ã‚Â both	 Ã‚Â within	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â  school	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  online	 Ã‚Â  platforms	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â well	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  same	 Ã‚Â  age	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  subject	 Ã‚Â

cluster	 Ã‚Â  meetings.	 Ã‚Â  Distance	 Ã‚Â  learning	 Ã‚Â  can	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  provided	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â  radio,	 Ã‚Â  television	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Open	 Ã‚Â

4. Encourage	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  mandate	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  expenditure	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  certain	 Ã‚Â  percentage	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  teacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â  professional	 Ã‚Â 
allowance	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â continuing	 Ã‚Â professional	 Ã‚Â development	 Ã‚Â activities;	 Ã‚Â 

5. Establish	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â  system	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â ensuring	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â master	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  required	 Ã‚Â competencies	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â ever	 Ã‚Â higher	 Ã‚Â 
levels	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â achievement	 Ã‚Â during	 Ã‚Â  their	 Ã‚Â careers.	 Ã‚Â This	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â done	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â putting	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â probation	 Ã‚Â 



 
	 Ã‚Â 

and	 Ã‚Â  requiring	 Ã‚Â  further	 Ã‚Â  mentoring,	 Ã‚Â  requiring	 Ã‚Â  some	 Ã‚Â  kind	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  recertification	 Ã‚Â  or	 Ã‚Â  confirmation	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â 
certification	 Ã‚Â every	 Ã‚Â five	 Ã‚Â years,	 Ã‚Â etc.;	 Ã‚Â 

6. Establish	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  implement	 Ã‚Â  procedures	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  underperforming	 Ã‚Â  teachers,	 Ã‚Â  including	 Ã‚Â  supervision,	 Ã‚Â 
support	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â possibly	 Ã‚Â probation	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â dismissal;	 Ã‚Â 

7. Providing	 Ã‚Â supportive	 Ã‚Â principals	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â supervisors,	 Ã‚Â who	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â held	 Ã‚Â accountable	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â assurance,	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â district	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â office	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â unit	 Ã‚Â focused	 Ã‚Â on	 Ã‚Â CPD	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â assurance;	 Ã‚Â 

8. Provide	 Ã‚Â mentoring	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â teachers	 Ã‚Â like	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Shanghai	 Ã‚Â where	 Ã‚Â mentors	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â mentees	 Ã‚Â regularly	 Ã‚Â observe	 Ã‚Â 
each	 Ã‚Â otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â lessons	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â observe	 Ã‚Â demonstration	 Ã‚Â lessons	 Ã‚Â together.	 Ã‚Â

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ DropoutÃ‚Â  ratesÃ‚Â areÃ‚Â moreÃ‚Â  significantÃ‚Â atÃ‚Â  juniorÃ‚Â  secondaryÃ‚Â  level.Ã‚Â  InÃ‚Â  theÃ‚Â  courseÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â  juniorÃ‚Â  secondaryÃ‚Â 
educationÃ‚Â 1.74%Ã‚Â ofÃ‚Â pupilsÃ‚Â dropÃ‚Â outÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â 8%Ã‚Â ofÃ‚Â pupilsÃ‚Â whoÃ‚Â successfullyÃ‚Â completeÃ‚Â juniorÃ‚Â secondaryÃ‚Â 
educationÃ‚Â doÃ‚Â notÃ‚Â continueÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â upperÃ‚Â secondaryÃ‚Â education.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ WhileÃ‚Â IndonesiaÃ‚Â isÃ‚Â comingÃ‚Â closeÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â achievingÃ‚Â universalÃ‚Â basicÃ‚Â education,Ã‚Â theÃ‚Â grossÃ‚Â enrolmentÃ‚Â rateÃ‚Â 
(GER)Ã‚Â forÃ‚Â seniorÃ‚Â secondaryÃ‚Â educationÃ‚Â isÃ‚Â justÃ‚Â 76%Ã‚Â (2011/12).Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ ChildrenÃ‚Â areÃ‚Â mostÃ‚Â likelyÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â dropÃ‚Â outÃ‚Â whenÃ‚Â transitioningÃ‚Â betweenÃ‚Â levelsÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â schooling.Ã‚Â OnceÃ‚Â aÃ‚Â childÃ‚Â 
startsÃ‚Â aÃ‚Â levelÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â schooling,Ã‚Â theyÃ‚Â areÃ‚Â likelyÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â completeÃ‚Â it.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 
ReasonsÃ‚Â forÃ‚Â dropoutÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â nonÃ¢â‚¬ÂenrolmentÃ‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ DropoutÃ‚Â ratesÃ‚Â areÃ‚Â higherÃ‚Â inÃ‚Â generalÃ‚Â primaryÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â juniorÃ‚Â secondaryÃ‚Â schoolsÃ‚Â thanÃ‚Â inÃ‚Â IslamicÃ‚Â primaryÃ‚Â 
andÃ‚Â juniorÃ‚Â secondaryÃ‚Â schoolsÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â madrasahÃ‚Â ibtidaiyahÃ‚Â (MI)Ã‚Â andÃ‚Â madrasahÃ‚Â tsanawiyahÃ‚Â (MTs).Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ UNICEFÃ‚Â hasÃ‚Â foundÃ‚Â thatÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â economicÃ‚Â statusÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â aÃ‚Â familyÃ‚Â hasÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â mostÃ‚Â significantÃ‚Â impactÃ‚Â onÃ‚Â accessÃ‚Â 
toÃ‚Â schoolÃ‚Â forÃ‚Â primaryÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â lowerÃ‚Â secondaryÃ‚Â schoolÃ‚Â ageÃ‚Â children.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ ChildrenÃ‚Â fromÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â poorestÃ‚Â 20%Ã‚Â ofÃ‚Â familiesÃ‚Â areÃ‚Â almostÃ‚Â fiveÃ‚Â timesÃ‚Â moreÃ‚Â  likelyÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â beÃ‚Â outÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â schoolÃ‚Â 
thanÃ‚Â thoseÃ‚Â fromÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â wealthiestÃ‚Â 20%Ã‚Â ofÃ‚Â families. 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ OtherÃ‚Â majorÃ‚Â causesÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â nonÃ¢â‚¬ÂattendanceÃ‚Â  includeÃ‚Â distanceÃ‚Â  toÃ‚Â school,Ã‚Â especiallyÃ‚Â  inÃ‚Â remoteÃ‚Â areasÃ‚Â  inÃ‚Â 
easternÃ‚Â Indonesia,Ã‚Â andÃ‚Â childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ‚Â disabilities,Ã‚Â especiallyÃ‚Â forÃ‚Â primaryÃ‚Â schoolÃ‚Â children.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 
PolicyÃ‚Â optionsÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

ImproveÃ‚Â availabilityÃ‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ EnsureÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â availabilityÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â schoolsÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â teachersÃ‚Â soÃ‚Â thatÃ‚Â allÃ‚Â childrenÃ‚Â canÃ‚Â accessÃ‚Â schoolÃ‚Â 

regardlessÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â theirÃ‚Â socioÃ¢â‚¬ÂeconomicÃ‚Â background 
Ã‚Â 

SupportÃ‚Â thoseÃ‚Â atÃ‚Â riskÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ TheÃ‚Â governmentÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â schoolsÃ‚Â needÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â engageÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â betterÃ‚Â supportÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â pupilsÃ‚Â atÃ‚Â greaterÃ‚Â riskÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â 

droppingÃ‚Â out,Ã‚Â especiallyÃ‚Â atÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â pointÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â transitionÃ‚Â fromÃ‚Â primaryÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â juniorÃ‚Â secondary,Ã‚Â 
throughoutÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â juniorÃ‚Â secondaryÃ‚Â educationÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â atÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â pointÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â transitionÃ‚Â fromÃ‚Â juniorÃ‚Â 
secondaryÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â seniorÃ‚Â secondary 

 

Ã‚Â 
ProgrammesÃ‚Â targetedÃ‚Â atÃ‚Â reducingÃ‚Â dropoutsÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â increasingÃ‚Â enrolmentÃ‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ InÃ‚Â 2005,Ã‚Â theÃ‚Â governmentÃ‚Â launchedÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â SchoolÃ‚Â OperationalÃ‚Â AssistanceÃ‚Â ProgrammeÃ‚Â (BOS),Ã‚Â asÃ‚Â aÃ‚Â wayÃ‚Â 
ofÃ‚Â injectingÃ‚Â fundsÃ‚Â directlyÃ‚Â intoÃ‚Â schoolsÃ‚Â inÃ‚Â orderÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â keepÃ‚Â childrenÃ‚Â  inÃ‚Â schoolÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â giveÃ‚Â schoolsÃ‚Â someÃ‚Â 
flexibilityÃ‚Â inÃ‚Â managingÃ‚Â theirÃ‚Â ownÃ‚Â funds.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ BOSÃ‚Â providesÃ‚Â  fundingÃ‚Â  toÃ‚Â primaryÃ‚Â  andÃ‚Â  juniorÃ‚Â  secondaryÃ‚Â  schoolsÃ‚Â  toÃ‚Â  financeÃ‚Â nonÃ¢â‚¬ÂpersonnelÃ‚Â  costsÃ‚Â 
basedÃ‚Â onÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â numberÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â students.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ FurtherÃ‚Â assistanceÃ‚Â isÃ‚Â providedÃ‚Â byÃ‚Â twoÃ‚Â otherÃ‚Â conditionalÃ‚Â cashÃ‚Â transferÃ‚Â programmes,Ã‚Â CashÃ‚Â TransfersÃ‚Â 
forÃ‚Â PoorÃ‚Â StudentsÃ‚Â  (BSM)Ã‚Â andÃ‚Â  theÃ‚Â FamilyÃ‚Â HopeÃ‚Â ProgrammeÃ‚Â  (PKH),Ã‚Â whichÃ‚Â  supportÃ‚Â  childrenÃ‚Â atÃ‚Â allÃ‚Â 
levelsÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â education.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ CashÃ‚Â transfersÃ‚Â areÃ‚Â contingentÃ‚Â onÃ‚Â aÃ‚Â numberÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â criteriaÃ‚Â includingÃ‚Â schoolÃ‚Â enrolmentÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â attendanceÃ‚Â 
andÃ‚Â directedÃ‚Â atÃ‚Â childrenÃ‚Â fromÃ‚Â poorÃ‚Â familiesÃ‚Â whoÃ‚Â mightÃ‚Â otherwiseÃ‚Â notÃ‚Â beÃ‚Â ableÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â attendÃ‚Â school.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ TheÃ‚Â  governmentÃ‚Â  hasÃ‚Â  recentlyÃ‚Â  introducedÃ‚Â  theÃ‚Â  SmartÃ‚Â  IndonesiaÃ‚Â  ProgrammeÃ‚Â  orÃ‚Â  KartuÃ‚Â  IndonesiaÃ‚Â 
PintarÃ‚Â  (KIP),Ã‚Â  whichÃ‚Â  buildsÃ‚Â  uponÃ‚Â  theÃ‚Â  BSMÃ‚Â  programmeÃ‚Â  byÃ‚Â  extendingÃ‚Â  coverageÃ‚Â  andÃ‚Â  expandingÃ‚Â 
eligibilityÃ‚Â forÃ‚Â cashÃ‚Â transfers.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 
ChallengesÃ‚Â forÃ‚Â achievementÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â universalÃ‚Â secondaryÃ‚Â educationÃ‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ TheÃ‚Â  costÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â  achievingÃ‚Â universalÃ‚Â  secondaryÃ‚Â educationÃ‚Â  isÃ‚Â huge.Ã‚Â ToÃ‚Â  reachÃ‚Â  theÃ‚Â  target,Ã‚Â  governmentÃ‚Â 

spendingÃ‚Â onÃ‚Â seniorÃ‚Â secondaryÃ‚Â educationÃ‚Â wouldÃ‚Â needÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â increaseÃ‚Â moreÃ‚Â thanÃ‚Â twofold.Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ CostsÃ‚Â  includeÃ‚Â  financingÃ‚Â  theÃ‚Â  constructionÃ‚Â  ofÃ‚Â  newÃ‚Â  schoolsÃ‚Â  andÃ‚Â  expandingÃ‚Â  BOSÃ‚Â  toÃ‚Â  coverÃ‚Â  theÃ‚Â 

operationalÃ‚Â costsÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â allÃ‚Â SMAs/SMKs.Ã‚Â 



Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ PrivateÃ‚Â  sectorÃ‚Â  participationÃ‚Â  canÃ‚Â  beÃ‚Â  harnessedÃ‚Â  toÃ‚Â  supportÃ‚Â  theÃ‚Â  governmentÃ‚Â  toÃ‚Â  expandÃ‚Â  access.Ã‚Â 
PrivateÃ¢â‚¬ÂpublicÃ‚Â partnershipsÃ‚Â couldÃ‚Â playÃ‚Â anÃ‚Â importantÃ‚Â roleÃ‚Â inÃ‚Â reachingÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ‚Â target.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ QualityÃ‚Â  ofÃ‚Â  educationÃ‚Â  atÃ‚Â  eachÃ‚Â  levelÃ‚Â  isÃ‚Â  generallyÃ‚Â  poor.Ã‚Â  IndonesianÃ‚Â  studentsÃ‚Â  performÃ‚Â  poorlyÃ‚Â  onÃ‚Â 
internationalÃ‚Â examinationsÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã‚Â abilitiesÃ‚Â suchÃ‚Â asÃ‚Â PISA,Ã‚Â comparedÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â thoseÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â countriesÃ‚Â likeÃ‚Â 
VietnamÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â Singapore.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ TheÃ‚Â expansionÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â seniorÃ‚Â secondaryÃ‚Â educationÃ‚Â willÃ‚Â notÃ‚Â haveÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â desiredÃ‚Â effectÃ‚Â onÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â skillsÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â 
workforceÃ‚Â ifÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â educationÃ‚Â receivedÃ‚Â byÃ‚Â studentsÃ‚Â isÃ‚Â notÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â goodÃ‚Â quality.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ GovernmentÃ‚Â programmesÃ‚Â  suchÃ‚Â  asÃ‚Â BOSÃ‚Â  andÃ‚Â BSMÃ‚Â  areÃ‚Â notÃ‚Â  functioningÃ‚Â optimally,Ã‚Â  especiallyÃ‚Â withÃ‚Â 
regardÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â timing,Ã‚Â targetingÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â dispersion.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ TheÃ‚Â  governmentÃ‚Â willÃ‚Â  notÃ‚Â  beÃ‚Â  ableÃ‚Â  toÃ‚Â  reachÃ‚Â  theÃ‚Â  targetÃ‚Â  alone.Ã‚Â  BuildingÃ‚Â  commonÃ‚Â  understandingÃ‚Â 
amongÃ‚Â stakeholdersÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â securingÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â supportÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â privateÃ‚Â sector,Ã‚Â communityÃ‚Â groupsÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â civilÃ‚Â 
societyÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â localÃ‚Â governmentsÃ‚Â willÃ‚Â beÃ‚Â keyÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â expandingÃ‚Â accessÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â qualityÃ‚Â education.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 
PolicyÃ‚Â optionsÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

FinancingÃ‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ IncreaseÃ‚Â governmentÃ‚Â spendingÃ‚Â onÃ‚Â seniorÃ‚Â secondaryÃ‚Â educationÃ‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ ExploreÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â possibilityÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â implementingÃ‚Â publicÃ¢â‚¬ÂprivateÃ‚Â partnershipsÃ‚Â asÃ‚Â aÃ‚Â meansÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â expandingÃ‚Â 

access 
 

QualityÃ‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ EnsureÃ‚Â thatÃ‚Â studentsÃ‚Â onÃ‚Â bothÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â vocationalÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â generalÃ‚Â tracksÃ‚Â developÃ‚Â strongÃ‚Â aÃ‚Â strongÃ‚Â setÃ‚Â 

ofÃ‚Â basicÃ‚Â skills.Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ ImproveÃ‚Â qualityÃ‚Â assuranceÃ‚Â inÃ‚Â seniorÃ‚Â secondaryÃ‚Â education.Ã‚Â 

 

EfficiencyÃ‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ ImproveÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â functionÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â programmeÃ‚Â suchÃ‚Â asÃ‚Â BOSÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â BSMÃ‚Â

Dropout	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  non-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âenrolment	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  major	 Ã‚Â  obstacles	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  reaching	 Ã‚Â  this	 Ã‚Â  goal.	 Ã‚Â  Millions	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  school-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âage	 Ã‚Â 
children	 Ã‚Â remain	 Ã‚Â out	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â school	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â variety	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â reasons.	 Ã‚Â Many	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â these	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â found	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â rural	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
remote	 Ã‚Â  areas,	 Ã‚Â  where	 Ã‚Â  poverty,	 Ã‚Â  vast	 Ã‚Â  distances	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  nearest	 Ã‚Â  school	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  poor	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â 
relevance	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â lead	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â dropout.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
It	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â often	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â rural	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â remote	 Ã‚Â areas	 Ã‚Â where	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â learn	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â least	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â classrooms.	 Ã‚Â Teacher	 Ã‚Â tend	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â 
less	 Ã‚Â  educated	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  suffer	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â  resource	 Ã‚Â  shortages	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  those	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  urban	 Ã‚Â  areas.	 Ã‚Â  This	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â 
reflected	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  poor	 Ã‚Â  performance	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  assessments	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  learning	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  Early	 Ã‚Â  Grade	 Ã‚Â  Reading	 Ã‚Â

Another	 Ã‚Â major	 Ã‚Â  cause	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  both	 Ã‚Â  dropout	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  poor	 Ã‚Â  learning	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  rural	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  remote	 Ã‚Â  areas,	 Ã‚Â  especially	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â 
Papua	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â West	 Ã‚Â  Papua,	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  children	 Ã‚Â  do	 Ã‚Â  not	 Ã‚Â  understand	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  language	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â  they	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  being	 Ã‚Â

the	 Ã‚Â classroom	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â learn	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â national	 Ã‚Â language,	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â often	 Ã‚Â unfamiliar	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â them.	 Ã‚Â This	 Ã‚Â represent	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â 
huge	 Ã‚Â waste	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â most	 Ã‚Â  important	 Ã‚Â  resource	 Ã‚Â  children	 Ã‚Â  bring	 Ã‚Â with	 Ã‚Â  them	 Ã‚Â when	 Ã‚Â  starting	 Ã‚Â  school,	 Ã‚Â  their	 Ã‚Â 
language	 Ã‚Â skills,	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â leads	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â slower	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â poorer	 Ã‚Â learning	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â feeling	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â they	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â being	 Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpushed	 Ã‚Â

neuroscience	 Ã‚Â show	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â children	 Ã‚Â who	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â access	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â mother	 Ã‚Â tongue	 Ã‚Â based	 Ã‚Â multilingual	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â 
(MTB-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬ÂMLE)	 Ã‚Â  develop	 Ã‚Â  better	 Ã‚Â  language	 Ã‚Â  skills	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  their	 Ã‚Â mother	 Ã‚Â  tongues	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  national	 Ã‚Â  languages	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â 
perform	 Ã‚Â  better	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  other	 Ã‚Â  subjects,	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  mathematics,	 Ã‚Â  compared	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  those	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  taught	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â 
monolingual	 Ã‚Â schools.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ While	 Ã‚Â different	 Ã‚Â models	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â MTB-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬ÂMLE	 Ã‚Â exist,	 Ã‚Â MTB-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬ÂMLE	 Ã‚Â generally	 Ã‚Â  involves	 Ã‚Â using	 Ã‚Â mother	 Ã‚Â tongues	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â 
the	 Ã‚Â  language	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  instruction	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  early	 Ã‚Â  grades	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  transitioning	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  instruction	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  national	 Ã‚Â 
language	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â later	 Ã‚Â grades.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Other	 Ã‚Â benefits	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â MTB-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬ÂMLE	 Ã‚Â include	 Ã‚Â lower	 Ã‚Â dropout	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â grade	 Ã‚Â repetition,	 Ã‚Â increased	 Ã‚Â parent	 Ã‚Â interest	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â participation	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â preservation	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â endangered	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â minority	 Ã‚Â languages.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Implementing	 Ã‚Â MTB-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬ÂMLE	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â widely	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â eastern	 Ã‚Â Indonesia,	 Ã‚Â especially	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Papua,	 Ã‚Â could	 Ã‚Â significantly	 Ã‚Â 
improve	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â outcomes	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â contribute	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â reducing	 Ã‚Â gaps	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â enrolment	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â dropout	 Ã‚Â between	 Ã‚Â 
western	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â eastern	 Ã‚Â Indonesia.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Nationally,	 Ã‚Â  steps	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  taken	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  introduce	 Ã‚Â mother	 Ã‚Â  tongues	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  early-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âgrade	 Ã‚Â  instruction.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â 
RPJMN	 Ã‚Â states	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â mother	 Ã‚Â  tongues	 Ã‚Â  should	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â used	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  language	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  instruction	 Ã‚Â until	 Ã‚Â  at	 Ã‚Â  least	 Ã‚Â 
grade	 Ã‚Â three	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â primary	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â where	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â do	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â understand	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â national	 Ã‚Â language.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ In	 Ã‚Â Papua,	 Ã‚Â similar	 Ã‚Â steps	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â taken	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Papua.	 Ã‚Â Regional	 Ã‚Â Regulation	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â Papua	 Ã‚Â No.	 Ã‚Â 3	 Ã‚Â states	 Ã‚Â that,	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Å“If	 Ã‚Â  Bahasa	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â  cannot	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  used	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  introductory	 Ã‚Â  language	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  delivering	 Ã‚Â  education,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
local	 Ã‚Â language	 Ã‚Â can	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â used	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â introductory	 Ã‚Â language.Ã¢â‚¬Â	 Ã‚Â

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Increase	 Ã‚Â awareness	 Ã‚Â among	 Ã‚Â communities,	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â administrators	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â practitioners	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â Tanah	 Ã‚Â 
Papua	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  MTB-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬ÂMLE	 Ã‚Â  can	 Ã‚Â  play	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  critically	 Ã‚Â  important	 Ã‚Â  role	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  improving	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  their	 Ã‚Â

Backgrounder	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â  12-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyear	 Ã‚Â  compulsory	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  programme	 Ã‚Â  seeks	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  build	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  success	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  its	 Ã‚Â  9-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyear	 Ã‚Â 
compulsory	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â programme,	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â was	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â effort	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â achieve	 Ã‚Â universal	 Ã‚Â basic	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â As	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â 
result	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â sustained	 Ã‚Â  investment,	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â now	 Ã‚Â very	 Ã‚Â close	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â achieving	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â goal	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â universal	 Ã‚Â basic	 Ã‚Â 
education.	 Ã‚Â Since	 Ã‚Â 2004,	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â gross	 Ã‚Â enrolment	 Ã‚Â rate	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â primary	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â more	 Ã‚Â than	 Ã‚Â 100%,	 Ã‚Â 
while	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  gross	 Ã‚Â  enrolment	 Ã‚Â  rate	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  junior	 Ã‚Â  secondary	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  increased	 Ã‚Â  from	 Ã‚Â  76.1%	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  2001	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â 
96.9%	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â 2013.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Nevertheless,	 Ã‚Â  some	 Ã‚Â communities	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â both	 Ã‚Â urban	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â rural	 Ã‚Â areas	 Ã‚Â offer	 Ã‚Â basic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â services	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â 
are	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  very	 Ã‚Â  poor	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  lack	 Ã‚Â  relevance	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  social	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  economic	 Ã‚Â  conditions	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  these	 Ã‚Â  areas.	 Ã‚Â 
Enhancing	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â basic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â key	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â achieving	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s	 Ã‚Â goal	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â universal	 Ã‚Â 
12-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyear	 Ã‚Â education.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â  quality	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  education	 Ã‚Â  services	 Ã‚Â  directly	 Ã‚Â  affects	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  decisions	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  children	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  their	 Ã‚Â  parents	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â 
remain	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â or	 Ã‚Â drop	 Ã‚Â out	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â school.	 Ã‚Â Provision	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â poor	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â basic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â will	 Ã‚Â lead	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â fewer	 Ã‚Â students	 Ã‚Â 
considering	 Ã‚Â it	 Ã‚Â worthwhile	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â continue	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â higher	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â level,	 Ã‚Â making	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â goal	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â universal	 Ã‚Â 12-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âyear	 Ã‚Â 
education	 Ã‚Â difficult	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â achieve.	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
The	 Ã‚Â  government	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  implemented	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  number	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  programs	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  recent	 Ã‚Â  years	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  address	 Ã‚Â  concerns	 Ã‚Â 
regarding	 Ã‚Â  quality.	 Ã‚Â One	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  initiative	 Ã‚Â  has	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  introduction,	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  2010,	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  set	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  27	 Ã‚Â minimum	 Ã‚Â 
service	 Ã‚Â standards	 Ã‚Â (MSS)	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â basic	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â intended	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â serve	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â an	 Ã‚Â instrument	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â manage	 Ã‚Â 
quality	 Ã‚Â  improvement.	 Ã‚Â  The	 Ã‚Â MSS	 Ã‚Â  aim	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  ensure	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  every	 Ã‚Â  school	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â madrasah	 Ã‚Â meets	 Ã‚Â  at	 Ã‚Â  least	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â 
minimum	 Ã‚Â conditions	 Ã‚Â needed	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â learning	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â occur.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 
Basic	 Ã‚Â Education	 Ã‚Â Minimum	 Ã‚Â Service	 Ã‚Â Standards	 Ã‚Â 
	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â MSS	 Ã‚Â provide	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â baseline	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â educational	 Ã‚Â services	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â need	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â delivered	 Ã‚Â by	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â districts	 Ã‚Â 
and	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â including	 Ã‚Â madrasah.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â MSS	 Ã‚Â consist	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â 27	 Ã‚Â individual	 Ã‚Â standards	 Ã‚Â including	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â provision	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â adequate	 Ã‚Â classrooms,	 Ã‚Â 
competent	 Ã‚Â  teachers	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  sufficient	 Ã‚Â  resources	 Ã‚Â  such	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â  textbooks	 Ã‚Â  (full	 Ã‚Â  list	 Ã‚Â  included	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â 
Appendix).	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â  standards	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â  divided	 Ã‚Â  into	 Ã‚Â  two	 Ã‚Â  areas:	 Ã‚Â  standards	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â must	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  fulfilled	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  district	 Ã‚Â 
government	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  standards	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  must	 Ã‚Â  be	 Ã‚Â  met	 Ã‚Â  by	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  school	 Ã‚Â  (by	 Ã‚Â  school	 Ã‚Â  management	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â 
teachers).	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â MSS	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â developed	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â basic	 Ã‚Â education,	 Ã‚Â covering	 Ã‚Â primary	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â  junior	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â 
schools,	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â were	 Ã‚Â  introduced	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  2010	 Ã‚Â  through	 Ã‚Â Ministerial	 Ã‚Â  Regulation	 Ã‚Â No.	 Ã‚Â  15	 Ã‚Â  on	 Ã‚Â Minimum	 Ã‚Â 
Service	 Ã‚Â Standards.	 Ã‚Â They	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â being	 Ã‚Â optimized	 Ã‚Â through	 Ã‚Â Ministerial	 Ã‚Â Regulation	 Ã‚Â No.	 Ã‚Â 23/2013	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â 
refinement	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â past	 Ã‚Â regulation.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â MSS	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â currently	 Ã‚Â being	 Ã‚Â developed	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â early	 Ã‚Â childhood	 Ã‚Â education	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â senior	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â 
education.	 Ã‚Â 



Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â minimum	 Ã‚Â service	 Ã‚Â standards	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â part	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â national	 Ã‚Â quality	 Ã‚Â assurance	 Ã‚Â system,	 Ã‚Â which	 Ã‚Â also	 Ã‚Â 
includes	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  national	 Ã‚Â  school	 Ã‚Â  accreditation	 Ã‚Â  system	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  National	 Ã‚Â  Education	 Ã‚Â  Standards	 Ã‚Â 
(NES).	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â MSS	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â considered	 Ã‚Â a	 Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬ËœbridgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢	 Ã‚Â towards	 Ã‚Â implementing	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â aspirational	 Ã‚Â NES.	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â MSS	 Ã‚Â may	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â adapted	 Ã‚Â over	 Ã‚Â time	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â reflect	 Ã‚Â changes	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â priorities	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â school	 Ã‚Â quality.	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
Progress	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â implementation	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â MSS	 Ã‚Â 

	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ A	 Ã‚Â  recent	 Ã‚Â  study	 Ã‚Â  found	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  there	 Ã‚Â  are	 Ã‚Â major	 Ã‚Â  shortfalls	 Ã‚Â  against	 Ã‚Â  minimum	 Ã‚Â  service	 Ã‚Â  standards,	 Ã‚Â 

with	 Ã‚Â no	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â meeting	 Ã‚Â them.	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The	 Ã‚Â  study	 Ã‚Â  found	 Ã‚Â  that	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  almost	 Ã‚Â  all	 Ã‚Â  areas	 Ã‚Â  had	 Ã‚Â  difficulties	 Ã‚Â  meeting	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  standards	 Ã‚Â 

related	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â providing	 Ã‚Â some	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â key	 Ã‚Â facilities	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â resources.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Books	 Ã‚Â and,	 Ã‚Â particularly,	 Ã‚Â facilities	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â equipment	 Ã‚Â for	 Ã‚Â science	 Ã‚Â teaching	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â both	 Ã‚Â elementary	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 

junior	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â level	 Ã‚Â are	 Ã‚Â too	 Ã‚Â often	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â short	 Ã‚Â supply.	 Ã‚Â In	 Ã‚Â most	 Ã‚Â cases,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â shortage	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â books	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â 
significant.	 Ã‚Â 	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ For	 Ã‚Â example,	 Ã‚Â just	 Ã‚Â 10%	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â junior	 Ã‚Â secondary	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â were	 Ã‚Â found	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â adequate	 Ã‚Â science	 Ã‚Â labs	 Ã‚Â 
with	 Ã‚Â furniture.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ However,	 Ã‚Â critical	 Ã‚Â shortfalls	 Ã‚Â have	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â found	 Ã‚Â not	 Ã‚Â only	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â school	 Ã‚Â resources	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â infrastructure,	 Ã‚Â 
which	 Ã‚Â  have	 Ã‚Â  been	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  primary	 Ã‚Â  concern	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  administrators,	 Ã‚Â  but	 Ã‚Â  also	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  important	 Ã‚Â  educational	 Ã‚Â 
processes	 Ã‚Â especially	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â areas	 Ã‚Â such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â supervision,	 Ã‚Â lesson	 Ã‚Â planning	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â student	 Ã‚Â assessment.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ For	 Ã‚Â  example,	 Ã‚Â  only	 Ã‚Â  23%	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  primary	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  just	 Ã‚Â  20%	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â  junior	 Ã‚Â  secondary	 Ã‚Â  schools	 Ã‚Â were	 Ã‚Â 
found	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â receive	 Ã‚Â monthly	 Ã‚Â visits	 Ã‚Â from	 Ã‚Â supervisors.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Performance	 Ã‚Â against	 Ã‚Â MSS	 Ã‚Â  tends	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â be	 Ã‚Â  lower	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â parts	 Ã‚Â  of	 Ã‚Â  Eastern	 Ã‚Â  Indonesia	 Ã‚Â  as	 Ã‚Â opposed,	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â 
example,	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â Java.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ It	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â estimated	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â cost	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â eliminating	 Ã‚Â current	 Ã‚Â shortfalls	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â ensure	 Ã‚Â that	 Ã‚Â all	 Ã‚Â schools	 Ã‚Â 
reach	 Ã‚Â minimum	 Ã‚Â service	 Ã‚Â levels	 Ã‚Â is	 Ã‚Â significant.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ For	 Ã‚Â example,	 Ã‚Â the	 Ã‚Â cost	 Ã‚Â of	 Ã‚Â eliminating	 Ã‚Â shortfalls	 Ã‚Â in	 Ã‚Â capital	 Ã‚Â budget	 Ã‚Â items,	 Ã‚Â such	 Ã‚Â as	 Ã‚Â buildings	 Ã‚Â and	 Ã‚Â 
classrooms,	 Ã‚Â alone	 Ã‚Â has	 Ã‚Â been	 Ã‚Â estimated	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â amount	 Ã‚Â to	 Ã‚Â at	 Ã‚Â least	 Ã‚Â Rp.	 Ã‚Â 20.232	 Ã‚Â trillion.	 Ã‚Â

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ There	 Ã‚Â  is	 Ã‚Â  a	 Ã‚Â  large	 Ã‚Â  opportunity	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â  eliminate	 Ã‚Â  these	 Ã‚Â  shortfalls	 Ã‚Â  -Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â	 Ã‚Â  especially	 Ã‚Â  those	 Ã‚Â  relating	 Ã‚Â  to	 Ã‚Â

additional	 Ã‚Â expenditure.	 Ã‚Â 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Eliminating	 Ã‚Â  shortfalls	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  these	 Ã‚Â  low-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Âcost	 Ã‚Â  areas,	 Ã‚Â  for	 Ã‚Â  example	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â  the	 Ã‚Â  teaching	 Ã‚Â  process	 Ã‚Â  and	 Ã‚Â  in	 Ã‚Â

Topic #9 
12-Years of Compulsory Education 
12-Years of Compulsory Education - Current State of Indonesia Secondary Education 
and Students Transition to Secondary Education 

 
Backgrounder 
 
IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 12-year compulsory education programme seeks to build on the success of its 9-year 
compulsory education programme, which was an effort to achieve universal basic education. As a 
result of sustained investment, Indonesia is now very close to achieving the goal of universal basic 
education. Since 2004, the gross enrolment rate for primary education has been more than 100%, 
while the gross enrolment rate for junior secondary education increased from 76.1% in 2001 to 
96.9% in 2013.  
 
Indonesia will need a strategy for implementing 12-year compulsory education. Such strategy would 
aim at increasing and upgrading education supply such as infrastructure, equipment and human 
resources, and also at ensuring there is adequate demand for senior secondary school. Among other 
things, this will entail identifying reasons children are not enrolling in school, dropping out of basic 
education and abstaining from transitioning from junior secondary to senior secondary school. 
Issues of retention that are not worked out at the primary level threaten to pose obstacles to 
reaching the goal of 12 year compulsory education.  
 
Drop out and transition rates 
 
National data shows that 2.4% of children of primary school age do not attend school. The dropout 
rate for primary schools in Indonesia was 1.09% in 2011/12. At the junior secondary level, dropout 
rates are more significant. At this level, 1.74% of students drop out. 
 
In regards to transition rates, Indonesia is one of a few countries that have high enrolment rates at 
lower secondary level but experience a drop in participation at upper secondary level. 95.3% of 
those who complete primary education move on to junior secondary school, while 4.7% do not 
move on to the next level of education. 8% of students who complete junior secondary school do 
not continue to senior secondary school.1

The drop out rate of general primary and junior secondary schools is significantly higher than for 
Islamic primary and junior secondary schools. In 2010/11, the dropout rate for SDs was 1.61% whole 
for MIs it was 0.18%. The dropout rate for junior secondary school was 1.41% while the dropout rate 
for Islamic junior secondary school (MT) was .06%.2 A recent OECD study on education in Indonesia 
suggests that the good relationship between teachers, pupils and parents in Islamic schools as well 
as these schoolsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ integration into the community may contribute to the retention of pupils.3 
 
Reasons children are not attending secondary education 
 
According to UNICEF, family wealth is the most significant factor influencing access to school at 
primary and junior secondary level. Children from the lowest household per capita expenditure 
quintile are almost five times more likely to be out of school than those from the highest. The same 
trend was observed for children of junior secondary school age.4 BOS funding to junior secondary 
schools and subsidies for poor students such as through the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cash Transfers for Poor 
Students (BSM) Programme have increased enrolment rates. However, a lack of financial resources 
is still the most important obstacle for families enrolling children in basic education.5 6 
 

Causes of non-attendance may include opportunity costs related to children forfeiting work to 
attend school and the inaccessibility of schools and teachers. In remote areas, especially in eastern 
Indonesia, there is a shortage of school facilities, and the distance children have to travel to reach 
school is too great for many communities. In 2012, approximately 43 percent of senior secondary 
students have to travel 4 kilometers or more to get to the nearest school. Senior secondary students 
in rural areas have to travel further than students in urban areas. Added transportation costs almost 
double the cost of education.  
 
Another reasons for low transition rates may be the selection examination given at the end of lower 
secondary school. Also, another cause of non-attendance could be parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ potential 
low expectation of school effectiveness in improving opportunities and employability, which is 
related to the perceived low quality of education. 
 
High rates of teacher absenteeism in disadvantaged areas are also considered to lead to low 
enrolment rates, especially in remote areas.7 Although there has been some improvement in teacher 
absenteeism in the last ten years, it is still a problem. Around 9.7% of teachers are absent from 
school in Indonesia and 13.5% are absent from class even when they are in school.8 Teacher

absenteeism is a severe problem in remote areas like Papua and West Papua, and the rate of 
teacher absenteeism in the Papua province is 37%.9  
 

Policy options 
 

To prevent drop out and ensure transition to senior secondary school, Indonesia will need to 
address issues such as cost of education and the availability of schools and teachers. 
 

Options for addressing education cost:    

Ã¯â€šÂ· Altering the BSM program by increasing the scholarship amount and improving the 
targeting of the program; 

Ã¯â€šÂ· Ensuring vocational and general education are of good quality and relevant to the labor 
market so that students will find it more beneficial to attend school than drop out to work 
in low level skill jobs; 

Ã¯â€šÂ· Strengthening non-formal education to ensure that out of age children can make it back 
into education. 

 

Options for addressing the availability of schools and teachers:  

Ã¯â€šÂ· Building more schools when necessary while also looking into alternate options for 
expensive investment in infrastructure; 

Ã¯â€šÂ· Optimizing the utilization of existing schools and classrooms; more than 50% of schools 
have less than 30 students per classroom, and about 25% of schools have less than 20 
students per classroom; 

Ã¯â€šÂ· Using other facilities such as government buildings to provide access in remote areas; 

Ã¯â€šÂ· Investigating ways of using public private partnerships (through private finance and public 
provision or public finance and private provision) to expand infrastructure; 

Ã¯â€šÂ· Re-evaluating policies and regulations such as the 24 period-hours per week minimum 
that lead to teacher absenteeism.

Indonesia would not be able to compete with other countries, particularly in the ASEAN region, if teachers are not supported as spearheads in producing highly skilled graduates. A framework and mechanism is needed to facilitate the continuous teacher development (CPD). Law 14/2005 on Teachers and Lecturers and the Ministerial Regulation 16/2007 have required teachers to possess academic qualifications and master competency standards. Indonesia presently has 33 quality assurance agencies and 12 national centers for subject training, which are responsible for the in?service training for teachers. However, CPD in Indonesia still requires significant improvement. A review by OECD reveals that many teachers do not receive any CPD and, moreover, receive little professional guidance by external facilitators, principals, supervisors, or even mentoring by experienced teachers. This critical weakness can be addressed by providing CPD programs related to the teacher qualification process, which would ensure its sustainability over a long?term, including professional trainings held in schools, provision of feedback on teacher performance and other support. Teacher Working Groups (Primary School Teacher Cluster or Kelompok Kerja Guru/KKG) and Secondary School Subject Teacher Cluster or Musyawarah Guru Mata Pelajaran/MGMP) has been acknowledged as the most appropriate and effective path which most teachers can take in receiving CPD. An alternative form that employs a similar strategy as KKGs and MGMPs is the ""Smart Teacher"" online platform (Guru Pintar Online/GPO) which is managed by Indonesia&#39;s Open University (Universitas Terbuka/UT). GPO opens the opportunities for teachers to help one another by sharing best practices and materials beyond their local teacher working groups. This backgrounder explains both.</p>

theÃ‚Â developmentÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â 21stÃ‚Â centuryÃ‚Â skills.Ã‚Â IndonesiaÃ‚Â wouldÃ‚Â notÃ‚Â beÃ‚Â ableÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â competeÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â wouldÃ‚Â loseÃ‚Â workÃ‚Â opportunitiesÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â

Ã‚Â 
InÃ‚Â  orderÃ‚Â  toÃ‚Â  achieveÃ‚Â  theseÃ‚Â  goals,Ã‚Â  aÃ‚Â  frameworkÃ‚Â  andÃ‚Â  mechanismÃ‚Â  isÃ‚Â  neededÃ‚Â  toÃ‚Â  facilitateÃ‚Â  theÃ‚Â  continuousÃ‚Â  teacherÃ‚Â

trainingÃ‚Â forÃ‚Â teachers.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
However,Ã‚Â CPDÃ‚Â  inÃ‚Â  IndonesiaÃ‚Â stillÃ‚Â  requiresÃ‚Â significantÃ‚Â  improvement.Ã‚Â AÃ‚Â reviewÃ‚Â byÃ‚Â OECDÃ‚Â revealsÃ‚Â  thatÃ‚Â manyÃ‚Â teachersÃ‚Â doÃ‚Â 
notÃ‚Â receiveÃ‚Â anyÃ‚Â CPDÃ‚Â and,Ã‚Â moreover,Ã‚Â receiveÃ‚Â littleÃ‚Â professionalÃ‚Â guidanceÃ‚Â byÃ‚Â externalÃ‚Â facilitators,Ã‚Â principals,Ã‚Â supervisors,Ã‚Â 
orÃ‚Â  evenÃ‚Â  mentoringÃ‚Â  byÃ‚Â  experiencedÃ‚Â  teachers.Ã‚Â  ThisÃ‚Â  criticalÃ‚Â  weaknessÃ‚Â  canÃ‚Â  beÃ‚Â  addressedÃ‚Â  byÃ‚Â  providingÃ‚Â  CPDÃ‚Â  programsÃ‚Â 
relatedÃ‚Â  toÃ‚Â  theÃ‚Â  teacherÃ‚Â  qualificationÃ‚Â  process,Ã‚Â  whichÃ‚Â  wouldÃ‚Â  ensureÃ‚Â  itsÃ‚Â  sustainabilityÃ‚Â  overÃ‚Â  aÃ‚Â  longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm,Ã‚Â  includingÃ‚Â

Ã‚Â 
ManyÃ‚Â studiesÃ‚Â haveÃ‚Â indicatedÃ‚Â thatÃ‚Â workingÃ‚Â inÃ‚Â networksÃ‚Â orÃ‚Â clustersÃ‚Â canÃ‚Â triggerÃ‚Â learningÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â improveÃ‚Â teachingÃ‚Â practice.Ã‚Â 
However,Ã‚Â  networksÃ‚Â  andÃ‚Â  clustersÃ‚Â  mayÃ‚Â  failÃ‚Â  toÃ‚Â  performÃ‚Â  ifÃ‚Â  theÃ‚Â  collaborationÃ‚Â  processÃ‚Â  inÃ‚Â  KKGÃ‚Â  andÃ‚Â  MGMPÃ‚Â  doesÃ‚Â  notÃ‚Â 
encourageÃ‚Â  teachersÃ‚Â  toÃ‚Â  reformÃ‚Â  theirÃ‚Â  teachingÃ‚Â  practice.Ã‚Â  ThisÃ‚Â  becomesÃ‚Â  importantÃ‚Â  becauseÃ‚Â  teacherÃ‚Â  knowledgeÃ‚Â  andÃ‚Â 
teachingÃ‚Â practiceÃ‚Â whichÃ‚Â studentsÃ‚Â experienceÃ‚Â everyÃ‚Â dayÃ‚Â inÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â classroomÃ‚Â isÃ‚Â aÃ‚Â determiningÃ‚Â factorÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â learningÃ‚Â outcomes.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
TeacherÃ‚Â  workingÃ‚Â  groupsÃ‚Â  suchÃ‚Â  asÃ‚Â  KKGs/MGMPsÃ‚Â  wouldÃ‚Â  provideÃ‚Â  betterÃ‚Â  outcomesÃ‚Â  ifÃ‚Â  they:Ã‚Â  (i)Ã‚Â  helpÃ‚Â  teachersÃ‚Â  focusÃ‚Â  onÃ‚Â

KOPI DARAT 

Kongkow Pendidikan: Diskusi Ahli dan Tukar Pendapat 

9 November 2016 

 

Topic #28 

 

ICT in Indonesian Education 

 

 

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has integrated into almost all aspects of modern life. ICT is changing 

the way people work, socialize and communicate, and it is influencing practices in the classroom as well. 

 

ICT in education has the potential to support the teaching and learning process. For example, social networks can be 

used creatively to enhance learning, and some teachers use Facebook to bring characters from novels and poems to 

life. Other teachers are Ã¢â‚¬Å“flipping the classroom,Ã¢â‚¬Â whereby they deliver lectures over the Internet or television during 

the evening to free time to work with children on assignments during the day.  

 

Teaching with ICT also ensures students have the knowledge and the digital skills they need for the 21
st

 century. 

Computer skills are among the top skills that Indonesian firms currently find lacking in graduates. And for Indonesia to 

achieve its future plans to invigorate the domestic ICT industry, it will need to create more graduates with computer 

skills, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (2014). 

 

ICT further has the potential to reduce inequities caused by income and geography. Schools are often important 

access points for disadvantaged students who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use ICTs at home. Open education resources and online 

networking platforms have improved access to learning materials and teacher development at all levels of education. 

And Open Universities and Massive Open Online Courses have expanded the reach of higher education. 

 

Yet, there are challenges in integrating ICT in education. Regardless of the potential, teachers and students all over the 

world are reporting far less ICT use during lessons than outside of school. And teachers are using ICT far more for 

administrative tasks than in their lessons. In addition to universal obstacles, Indonesia faces its own unique challenges 

in bringing ICT into the classroom including its geographical complexity, diverse demography and growing power 

needs.  

 

ICT in education in Indonesia 

 

In 1978, Indonesia established Pustekkom (Centre for Information and Communication Technology for Education) for 

the express purpose of delivering educational IT content to schools. While the original focus was audio, radio, video, 

film and television, Pustekkom is now responsible for the use of web-based technologies for teaching and learning as 

well as teacher and school networking and connectivity. Based in Jakarta and under the responsibility of the Ministry 

of Education and Culture (MoEC), Pustekkom is also responsible for the professional development of the teaching 

workforce and for the delivery of online teaching and learning services such as Portal Rumah Belajar, professional 

learning and connecting schools to the Internet via Jardiknas and School Net.  

 

One initiative of Pustekkom was Rumah Belajar, which was developed to allow teachers and students access digital 

materials for learning purposes on mobile devices. Rumah Belajar was created by adapting subject matter content 

used in television, but the file sizes of learning materials has created challenges in areas where cellular bandwidth was 

not strong, which is especially the case in non-urban areas.   

 

Another initiative of Pustekkom was the School Net or Jardiknas, which was aimed at developing networks of various 

schools, education institutions and government agencies. Serving as a primary means of communication between the 

Dinas Pendidikan, schools, universities and other tertiary learning institution, Jardiknas has disseminated learning 

resources, increased access to Rumah Belajar materials and provided online professional development for teachers 

about curriculum. Jardiknas has also provided service to remote areas like Papua. In 2013, about 300 basic (SD), junior 

secondary (SMP) and senior secondary schools (SMA) in Papua were linked through Jardiknas.   



 

 

 

The Open University (Universitas Terbuka or UT) was established 32 years ago in Indonesia to provide open and long 

distance learning. UT services some 300,000 students across Indonesia as well as students living in 28 countries, and 

provides learning services such as online tutorials, a digital library, a virtual reading room, digital materials, TV and 

radio courses, online- based courses and open educational resources (OER) for easy access to educational materials.  

 

Schools across Indonesia have varied in their effective use of ICT. A 2015 review of education in Indonesia showed 

that some vocational senior secondary schools had well planned and funded ICT. In others, resources were scarce and 

there was a struggle to keep up with the pace of technological change. During one of ACDPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Kopi Darat sessions on 

SMK expansion, it was revealed that an SMK responsible for training electricians did not have electricity in the school.  

 

Indonesia has many challenges to overcome in improving ICT use in schools. One of its biggest challenges is and will 

continue to be providing electricity to over 6,000 inhabited islands and a growing population. Although Indonesia is 

endowed with some of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest reserves of fossil fuels, the country has an undersupply of power, the 

lowest electrification rates in the region and national electricity demand that is expected to increase by an average of 

9% per year. To overcome obstacles and resolve energy dilemmas, Indonesia will need to continue reforming the 

sector while finding short-term solutions to power schools. 

 

Another challenge is Internet connectivity. In 2014, Indonesia ranked second lowest in the Asia-Pacific region in terms 

of average Internet connection speed (around 1.5 Mbps), and many of the population are demanding faster and 

better access. School budgets that target ICT are also needed, and this includes ICT related expenses such as network 

infrastructure, digital devices, training and professional learning activities, platforms for sharing good practices, 

technical support and maintenance and security and safety provisions.  

 

Teachers 

 

Incorporating ICT into education involves more than getting a computer into the classroom. Teachers are being 

required to teach IT to students and to use IT to teach other subjects, but they are often lacking the requisite 

knowledge and skills themselves. A recent survey from Europe revealed that a teacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s confidence in their own 

digital skills was more important for effectively teaching with ICT than having sufficient infrastructure and ICT access.  

 

UNESCO developed an ICT Competency Framework for teachers to show that students learn and adapt ICT in phases, 

much like literacy. The UNESCO framework has been adopted by MoEC and framed within Ministerial Regulation No. 

16 of 2007 on Teacher Competency. The three phases for teaching students IT skills are as follows: 

 

1. Technology literacy: teaching students to use IT efficiently; 
2. Knowledge deepening: building students skills in IT to allow them to use it to acquire in-depth knowledge 

and apply this to real world problems; 

3. Knowledge creation: enabling students to create new knowledge using IT to contribute to prosperous 
societies in a fulfilling way as citizens and workers. 

 

Teachers can also use ICT to form networks and share resources and best practices with other teachers in their own 

school, regionally and globally. SEA Edu-Net was established South East Asia network and resources repository where 

teachers could share materials. More recently, SEA Edu-Net has become a virtual class platform for teachers to 

support interactive communication and learning. 

 

Teacher training must go beyond giving teachers IT competencies by also teaching them to be adept in using a wide 

range of pedagogies to help students become creative, problem-solving and collaborative learners who are well 

prepared to live and work in the modern world. Teachers without digital skills might find it difficult to start using ICT in 

the classroom, and teacher training should support them by demonstrating the type of desired instructions. Currently, 

there is little ICT training in teacher colleges in Indonesia.  

 

To update the skills of teachers and leaders, teacher training institutions are needed that provide ICT professional 

learning and ICT pedagogical skills that are integrated into the curriculum.  Communities can be established within 



 

 

schools as well to offer regular support to teachers in ICT skills and knowledge and to allow sharing of effective 

pedagogical practices. Teacher education institutions in remote areas such as Papua will need to prepare teachers to 

adapt to unique conditions. 

 

Regional inequities 

 

ICT can reduce inequities by increasing access to education and learning resources. However, infrastructure issues 

have meant that rural students are still being lost in the digital gap.  

 

Telecommunications infrastructure is one main challenge in remote locations, which often have no or little access to 

telephone and Internet service. A 2015 ACDP study showed that there was only about 30% electrification in Papua 

and unstable power in urban and suburban areas. And 78% of primary schools and 8% of secondary schools were 

found to be reliant on diesel generators for evening use.  

 

The fibre-optic cable Palapa Ring East is expected to improve telecommunications for certain areas in Papua, but more 

could also be done. This might include exploring innovative solutions such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Telco in a boxÃ¢â‚¬Â, which bundles and 

provides the infrastructure needed to supply mobile and fixed line phone services and dial-up and DSL Internet access. 

 

Other challenges in Papua and other remote areas include limited ICT hardware, software and ICT opportunities. In 

Papua, most schools had less than 5 computers and 50% had only 1-2 computers. Although ICT subjects were 

compulsory, students were not using computers at school. Only 20% of students were shown to use computers at 

least once a week, and 73% had no access to the Internet at school. TV-Edukasi, which provides television learning, 

was used more, by about 30-40% of respondents, and mostly when teachers were absent. However, there are 

questions about the future of TV-based materials in the age of the Internet and online materials. 

 

A survey of principals in Papua revealed that funding for ICT came mostly from the national, provincial and Kabupaten 

funds. Both private and public schools seemed to access these funding streams to some extent. For about 25% of 

Papuan schools, school committees and parents contributed funds for ICT. The results to this survey are seen in the 

box below. 

 

ICT Funding: Results from Principal Survey in Papua 

 
 

Teachers in Papua were found to require more support in building computer skills and using ICT in the classroom. 

Although 90% of teachers and principals reported believing that ICT has benefits for student learning in terms of 

knowledge, collaboration, creativity and communication, 70% of teachers were shown to be using computers mostly 

for administrative work and not in the classroom. The teachers who were using ICT in the classroom were mostly 

working with students at the technology literacy stage established by UNESCO, indicating the need for enhancing 

teacher pedagogical skills and understanding of the potential for ICT use by students.  

 



 

 

Private sector involvement 

 

Public-Private Partnerships are often supported by governments for integrating ICT into education. Reasons for this 

relate to cost and financing as well as the perception that ICT experience is best found in the private sector.  The 

private sector also benefits from bringing ICT into education through having access to a well-educated and skilled 

population as well as having sufficient telecommunications infrastructure. PPPs have been used in many countries to 

for developing telecommunications infrastructure, accelerating schoolsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ access to requisite hardware and software 

and providing educational and professional training. 

 

Most ICT implementation partnerships in basic education are government-led, such as those found in Australia, 

Malaysia and Singapore. The most common partnerships emphasize front-end costs and capital costs. However, these 

often underestimate the total cost of ownership of computers and other equipment, which include recurrent costs 

such as hardware maintenance and upgrades to hardware and software. Teachers also have to devote additional time 

and effort to learning new skills, content development, approaches to learning and methods of assessment.  

 

Singapore based ICT company Litespeed is an example of a private sector firm that works with schools and teachers to 

develop customized e-learning content, and has entered into partnerships with education authorities in Hong Kong, 

Malaysia and Singapore to provide an integrated e-education platform for schools.   

 

India has explored using numerous PPPs to equip secondary schools with computer labs and to use ICT interventions 

to target girls, rural children, urban underprivileged children and children with special needs.   

 

The Saksham Initiative was an example of a partnership with Microsoft to provide IT training to faculty members with 

non-IT backgrounds from colleges and universities.  

 

Online training is also provided by Indian company Aptech as part of a Government Initiative to provide software 

design and applications training to participants from a range of sectors including education.  

 

Jordan has also been noted for its use of PPPs to bring ICT into schools. Jordan Education Initiative was initiated in 

2003 and involved multiple private sector partnerships to provide schools with the hardware and software needed to 

achieve effective pedagogical integration of ICT. The initiative was considered successful in accelerating Internet 

connectivity and computer availability in schools while giving Ministries necessary expertise in technology 

implementation and exposing teachers to new ways of teaching.  

 

International agencies and NGOs have also invested in providing ICT to the basic education sector. The Asian 

Development Bank and the World Bank have implemented initiatives aimed at setting up computer labs in schools, 

and developing an e-curriculum with appropriate learning materials. US-based NGO World Links for Development has 

worked with state governments in India to train secondary school teachers in 125 Indian schools in classroom 

applications of ICT. 

 

Policy Options 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Investigating and acting upon solutions for sustainable power and improved telecommunications 
infrastructure while also considering alternative energy sources and developing innovative solutions for 

remote areas; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Improving internet connectivity by developing plans and resourcing across ministries while also negotiating 
with various funders to ensure sufficient and targeted budgets with adequate monitoring; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Providing school budgets that target ICT, including ICT related expenses such as network infrastructure, 
digital devices, training and professional learning activities, platforms for sharing good practices, technical 

support and maintenance and security and safety provisions; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Establishing teacher training institutions that provide ICT professional learning and ICT pedagogical skills that 
are integrated into the curriculum, while also increasing specialist workshops for principals and teachers and 

developing communities within schools to offer regular support to teachers in ICT skills and effective 

pedagogical practices; 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Exploring Public-Private Partnership options for providing ICT hardware, software and teacher training.

Based on qualitative and quantitative data collected from 120 madrasah in sample locations, this study maps out and analyses the current practices surrounding madrasah funding and it identifies alternative policy instruments to improve public funding of madrasahs. The analysis finds that madrasahs, particularly private madrasahs, cannot rely on community funding to achieve MSS and the National Education Standards. Based in part on the conclusion that the quality of madrasah impacts the quality of the entire education system, this study recommends more government funds to enable madrasah improve education quality and provides alternative policy instruments to improve public funding of madrasah, particularly private madrasah.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">The madrasah sub-system is disadvantaged compared to general (MoEC) schools in terms of access to public financial resources. At the central level, budgets are allocated for education managed by MoEC and MoRA at a ratio of 80:20 to represent the proportional contribution towards enrolment between MoEC schools and madrasah. While the salaries and incentives for civil servant teachers in madrasah must be paid from this budget allocation, personnel costs for public MoEC schools are covered by the general allocation funds transferred separately to the district governments. Public madrasah, however, are compensated for this by MoRA's skewed allocation system, whereby public madrasah receive on average far more funding from MoRA than do private madrasah. Local governments are constrained in providing financial support to madrasah. As a result private madrasah largely rely on parental contributions, even though in general, private madrasahs cater to the poorest segments of society.

The report outlines efforts being made by the various levels of government to support an expansion of the sector and presents international experience as well as Indonesia&#39;s experience in increasing access to primary and junior secondary schooling. The study focuses on topics such as financing different types of public SMA; the financial responsibilities of the different levels of government; the financial responsibility of parents, who currently contribute more than 75% of operational costs (non-salary) in public schools; developing simple service standards; and developing strategic policy options. The report recommends policy options such as improving efficiency, particularly in the use of teachers as Indonesia&#39;s student-teacher ratio as low at 13.5:1, to free up resources for financing. In addition, the report recommends promoting closer partnerships with the private sector. The report recommends a further study to construct financing scenarios in order to model the various estimates, their consequences and costs.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">Funding of general senior secondary education is complex and varies throughout the country. It involves different levels of government providing financial support for infrastructure, salaries and operational costs. A common feature of the senior secondary sub-sector is its dependence on parental contributions in the form of both direct and indirect costs. There are also high opportunity costs of sending children to senior secondary school set against the perceived returns of this level of schooling. These factors have implications for school quality and for equity. The study found considerable variation in the levels of cost and the amounts of available revenue among state senior secondary schools (SMA), with the RSBI being far better resourced than the rest. Various levels of government are making efforts to support the expansion of senior secondary education. These include investment in school building, subsidizing operational costs and providing scholarships.</p>","<ul><li>Increasing participation in senior secondary school through structural innovations, such as the grouping of schools, filial/hybrid schools and distance learning to complement school building activities.</li><li>Freeing up resources for expansion by spending more efficiently, especially on the major cost item, the use of teachers.</li><li>Promoting closer partnerships with the private sector as a further option for managing the expansion of enrolments.</li><li>Creating a clear regulatory framework for expected minimum standards of education in private providers that receive public funding.</li><li>Increasing demand among lower income groups by various interventions including various forms of cash transfers and scholarships.</li></ul>","Pembiayaan Pendidikan Menengah Atas di Indonesia","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Laporan ini mendiskusikan sejumlah pilihan kebijakan dan implikasi pendanaannya, terkait misi pemerintah untuk mengembangkan pendidikan mengenah atas di Indonesia dengan meningkatkan angka partisipasi dari 70% menjadi 85% di tahun 2014.

The Ministry of National Education, now the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC), Strategic Plan 2010-2014 gave priority to the development of professional competencies of school and madrasah principals and supervisors. Principal and supervisor competencies were defined and articulated in the National Education Standards (NES) and Ministerial Decrees 12/2007 and 13/2007. MoEC and Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA) required baseline data about the current competency levels of principals and supervisors to inform and guide future Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programs. The purpose of the study was to: (1) Assess the level of competence of school supervisors and school principals based on the competencies in Ministerial Decrees No. 12/2007 and 13/2007 and the distribution of their competencies against agreed variables; (2) Develop a profile of the attributes of school supervisors and school principals to inform future CPD programs; (3) Analyse the future CPD needs of school supervisors and school principals; (4) Determine the extent to which Ministerial Decrees No. 12/2007 and 13/2007 have been implemented by districts, and; (5) Assess the impact of the 2010 Interim Presidential Staff Strengthening Program (INPRES) on participating school supervisors and principals. The study was also required to collect quantitative and qualitative information to address these objectives from samples of MoEC and MoRA principals, school supervisors, teachers, parents and district office education heads in seven regions of Indonesia: Sumatra; Java; Kalimantan; Nusa Tenggara; Sulawesi; Maluku and Papua. Findings include how there are many principals and supervisors who have participated in very little CPD in the last three years y very few supervisors or principals had participated in well-structured and cohesive preparation programs prior to their appointment or induction programs after their appointment. The study also provides some policy options.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">Both principals and supervisors often lack competency in key areas related to their roles. While participation in CPD activities is low for both groups, participation in INPRES appears to have had a positive impact on the competencies.

The results of the evaluation indicate some positive impact in terms of improved motivation for students to attend school, increased attention spans, indication of improved academic performance, and a positive impact in empowering certain members of the community and in contributing to the local economy. However, failure to adhere to feeding schedules in practice resulted in under achievement of program objectives. Funding allocations also did not take into account variability in costs and availability of locally procured products and ingredients. The evidence also indicates a lack of full understanding of nutrition on the part of program implementers in the school which can be attributed in large part to inadequate training. All these factors contribute to the lack of impact expected on improved nutrition.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">Children aged 4-12 show a deficit in RDA calories and a 20% deficit in protein. Shortcomings were identified in school infrastructure used for providing drinking water and sanitation, and there was a lack of provision of deworming medicines. Unit costs allocated for PMTAS were less than international average costs for full lunch meals but more than the average cost of nutritional biscuits. Funds were not designated for management, resulting in lack of coordination, monitoring and reporting. The program was not fully implemented as intended because funds were delayed in reaching schools. Total funds were often insufficient to provide supplements required.

Meskipun program PMT-AS hanya dilaksanakan selama dua tahun (2010 dan 2011), namun terdapat cukup bukti bahwa program tersebut memiliki nilai potensi yang besar. Hasil evaluasi menunjukkan beberapa dampak positif seperti bertambahnya motivasi murid untuk bersekolah, bertambahnya rentang perhatian terhadap pelajaran, tanda meningkatnya prestasi sekolah, dan dampak positif dalam memberdayakan anggota masyarakat tertentu dan dalam memberikan kontribusi terhadap perekonomian setempat. Selain itu bukti lain menunjukkan bahwa aspek-aspek dalam program ini telah direncanakan dengan baik, seperti membuat resep kudapan yang bergizi dan disukai hingga siap dikonsumsi oleh murid. Tetapi, kegagalan dalam mematuhi jadwal pemberian makanan pada hakikatnya mengakibatkan rendahnya pencapaian tujuan program. Terutama dikarenakan oleh keterlambatan dan kurangnya jumlah dana yang diterima tempat sasaran. Pengalokasian dana juga tidak mempertimbangkan adanya variasi dalam hal biaya dan ketersediaan produk dan bahan baku yang diperoleh di daerah setempat. Bukti juga mengindikasikan masih kurangnya pemahaman mengenai gizi di kalangan sebagian pelaksana program di sekolah yang kemungkinan terutama disebabkan oleh tidak cukupnya pelatihan. Semua hal ini berkontribusi pada kurangnya dampak yang diharapkan terhadap perbaikan gizi.

In addition, this research also provides conclusions and recommendations on policy options and strategy to prevent the infiltration of radicalism. Furthermore, this study has also led to the development of enrichment materials for Islamic religious education curriculum content, to include values of democracy, socio-cultural diversity, and human rights. A key part of this is to improve the teaching and learning methodology of the Islamic religious education built on problem-solving, creativity and encouraging critical thinking of learners. Current initiatives being implemented by the Directorate of Islamic Religious Education in improving the quality and the role of Islamic religious education in schools are enhanced using the recommendations from this research, namely: (1) Enriching the design of teacher&#39;s guideline on &quot;Multiculturalism Education&quot;; (2) Fostering the Islamic leaders or counselors of the Islamic extra-curricular activities in the form of national jamboree; (3) Organizing similar training for the counselors of the Subject Teacher Forum of Islamic Religious Education (MGMP-PAI); (4) Preparing the candidates of national, provincial, and district trainers in the improvement of the Islamic religious learning methodology based on problem-solving and critical thinking to provide training for all Islamic religious teachers in Indonesia; and (5) Preparing specific teacher training guidelines and materials for Islamic religious teachers in schools. This study, and its associated programs and activities for improving the teaching of Islamic Religious Education, will be a key reference to the officers and staff in the Directorate of Islamic Religious Education, provincial/district Regional Offices, organizers of the Subject Teacher Forum of Islamic Religious Education (MGMP-PAI), and Islamic Religious Education teachers. In addition the study will be important for school principals, staff of Regional Education Service Offices, leaders of Islamic community organization, and parents.</p>

"109","Study on Teacher Absenteeism in Indonesia 2014","Study-on-Teacher-Absenteeism-in-Indonesia-2014","<p style=""text-align:justify"">This project involved one of the most large-scale studies of teacher absenteeism undertaken anywhere in the world. Specially trained teams made two unannounced visits to a final sample of 880 primary and junior secondary schools across six regions. By building on earlier work on teacher absence in Indonesia, the study design also allowed analysis of change in absence rates and the impact of selected policies and programs over time. The study found only one in ten teachers to be absent from school. These results are encouraging, but are not grounds for complacency as 12%-14% of teachers scheduled to teach were found in school but not in the classroom. Teachers who were absent from the classroom were most frequently found in school but doing activities that were not academic or administrative. Absence rates varied widely among different types of teachers, regions and schools, and the study identified characteristics that contributed to higher rates of absenteeism. For example, rates were generally higher among male teachers than female teachers, teachers who worked at more than one school, teachers in remote areas, schools with poor physical facilities and schools where the principal was not present. High rates of teacher absence were found to adversely affect the operations of schools, other teachers and students. The study makes policy-related recommendations for reducing and better managing teacher absenteeism and its impact at the national, district and school level. Suggestions include reconsidering current national policies on teachers&#39; working hours, strengthening support and supervision of the teaching and learning process, strengthening principal selection and competency development and providing schools with clear policies and support for managing teacher absence so as to minimize the impact it has on students.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">Around one in ten teachers were found to be absent from school; by building on a previous study and collecting current data from a final sample of 880 primary and junior secondary schools, this study was able to track a decade of change. The study found the absence rate to have dropped from approximately 19% in 2003 to 10% in 2013. This rate is still too high. Rather than absence from school, teacher absence from the classroom is the emerging issue. Among teachers who were scheduled to teach, 14% were found in school but not in the classroom during the first visit, and 12% during the second visit. Using data collected from over 8,300 teachers and 8,200 students this study identified teacher, school and regional characteristics that contributed to absenteeism, the effects teacher absence had on learning outcome and the impact specific policies have had on teacher absenteeism.</p>","<ul><li>At the national level, reconsidering the current national policies on teachers' working hours, so as to reduce the need for teachers to work at more than one school.</li><li>Strengthening standards concerning teachers' use of their non-teaching time, encouraging and supporting teachers to use time outside class in ways that benefit students and holding meetings and training outside regular teaching hours whenever possible.</li><li>At the district level, strengthening support and supervision of the teaching and learning process through regular and focused visits by district supervisors and finding ways of recording and tracking absence levels and instructional time.</li><li>At the school level, providing schools with clear policies and support for managing teacher absences and substitute teachers in ways that minimize the impact on students.</li><li>Strengthening principal selection and competency development as a key to promoting a 'presence and engagement culture' among teachers.</li></ul>","Studi Ketidak Hadiran Guru di Indonesia, 2014","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Proyek ini merupakan salah satu kajian ketidakhadiran guru dengan skala yang sangat luas. Tim yang dilatih secara khusus membuat dua kali kunjungan mendadak ke 880 sekolah dasar dan sekolah menengah pertama di enam wilayah. Dibuat berdasarkan kajian sebelumnya dengan topik yang sama, desain kajian ini juga memungkinkan untuk dilakukannya analisis perubahan serta dampak sejumlah kebijakan dan program pada tingkat ketidakhadiran dari waktu ke waktu. Kajian ini menemukan satu dari setiap sepuluh guru absen dari sekolah. Hasil ini cukup menggembirakan, tetapi tetap tidak boleh lengah mengingat 12% -14% guru yang dijadwalkan untuk mengajar tidak hadir di kelas namun berada di sekolah. Guru yang absen dari kelas paling sering ditemukan berada di sekolah namun tidak sedang melakukan kegiatan akademis maupun administratif. Tingkat ketidakhadiran bervariasi antar jenis guru, daerah dan sekolah, dan kajian ini menemukan karakteristik yang berkontribusi terhadap tingginya tingkat ketidakhadiran. Sebagai contoh, tingkat ketidakhadiran umumnya lebih tinggi pada guru laki-laki dibanding guru perempuan, guru yang bekerja di lebih dari satu sekolah, guru-guru di daerah terpencil, sekolah dengan fasilitas yang buruk dan sekolah yang kepala sekolahnya juga tidak hadir. Tingginya tingkat ketidakhadiran guru mempengaruhi kegiatan sekolah, guru-guru lain dan siswa. Kajian ini menawarkan opsi kebijakan untuk mengurangi dan mengelola ketidakhadiran guru dengan lebih baik dan mengatasi dampaknya di tingkat nasional, tingkat sekolah dan kabupaten. Saran yang diberikan termasuk mempertimbangkan kembali kebijakan nasional mengenai kuota jam kerja guru, memperkuat dukungan dan pengawasan proses belajar dan mengajar, memperkuat seleksi kepala sekolah dan mengembangkan kompetensi serta memberikan sekolah kebijakan dan dukungan yang jelas untuk menangani ketidakhadiran guru sehingga dapat mengurangi dampaknya terhadap siswa.</p>","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/report-acdp011-en-pt.jpg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/report-acdp011-en-lc.jpg","","","download/collection/109-Study-on-Teacher-Absenteeism-in-Indonesia-2014.pdf","","ACDP Indonesia","","Teachers; Teacher Attendance;Teacher Management;Teacher Behavior;Teacher Discipline;School Administration;Governance;State Regulation;Standards;School Administration;Educational Quality","Pertumbuhan Ekonomi; Pendidikan; Kemajuan ekonomi; Dampak pada Ekonomi; Perencanaan Strategis","This project involved one of the most large-scale studies of teacher absenteeism undertaken anywhere in the world.

The economic and industrial strategy pursued by the present government, like the previous, recognizes that this is not a sufficient basis for achieving the country&#39;s full potential, and is focused on developing intellectual, manufacturing and servicebased industries that can add value to the abundant raw materials and agricultural goods that are produced. And it recognizes also that it will not achieve this unless its workforce is educated to a far higher level than at present, unless it&#39;s education institutions and economic needs of far better aligned, and its research and innovation base strengthened to enable it to make discoveries and to exploit these discoveries &quot; as well as innovations and discoveries made elsewhere &quot; in order to develop new advanced products and services. The present project is concerned with the education implications of the economic and industrial strategy and what will be required in order to bring it to fruition, together with the identifying the labour market information that will be required and a system for providing this. The study provides an analysis of rising demand for skills across various sectors in Indonesia, the capacity of skills development and higher education institutions, capacity of research and innovation, and labour market information system in Indonesia.

","<p style=""text-align:justify"">66% of companies plan to hire more workers across the four regions of Indonesia during next 3-5 years, while 31% do not plan to hire. Occupations requiring higher technical skills and management expertise are expected to be in highest demand. There is a mismatch between worker availability and required skills. Wage data suggests that SMK and SMA graduates who go directly to work fare similarly in the formal sector labor market and have similar unemployment rates. Demand for university education is high and likely will continue to grow. Only in the largest universities (public and private) has growth not exceeded 50% in the past 5 years. However, increasing the number of university graduates will not impact economic progress unless quality and relevance improvements occur through such means such as accreditation and curriculum review. Indonesia currently performs worse than the majority of neighbours on most measures of research performance, particularly publications, patents, faculty quali cations and nance.

At the turn of the century, over 1.5 million students were out of school but today, Indonesia is close to achieving universal basic education. These efforts have involved relatively high levels of investment on educational facilities, teaching personnel and learning materials. The challenge is to consolidate these gains and develop an education system that will better support the needs of a rapidly emerging economy in its transition towards high-income status.

The key purpose of the BE-MSS is to provide: &quot;a benchmark or standard for the performance of basic education services delivered through the formal education system administered by districts/cities&quot;. The standards are to act as an interim step to basic education schools and madrasahs achieving the National Education Standard (NES) and are to describe: &quot;(the) required kind and quality of basic services which districts/cities are obliged to provide and which every citizen has a right to receive as a minimal level of service delivery&quot;. The standards are defined by 27 performance indicators (PIs) covering the areas of access, infrastructure, staffing, teaching resources, teaching process and school/madrasah management. The 2013 BE-MSS survey was commissioned to provide information on the achievement of BE-MSS PIs in a national sample of districts/cities and schools/madrasahs and to measure progress by comparing results with those of the BE- MSS Baseline Survey conducted in 2010. The survey covered six regions of Indonesia: Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali &amp; Nusa Tenggara and Maluku and Papua. The sample was also structured to cover three levels of socio-economic &quot;advancement&quot; of districts/cities: advanced, medium advanced and less advanced. The schools/madrasahs were randomly selected, and the overall design of the sample ensured that it was representative of Indonesia&#39;s formal basic education system. Overall, the results of the survey show that Indonesia still has some distance to travel to ensure that all its formal basic education providers operate at a level of quality acceptable as a minimum service standard. At the district/city level, the access to basic education required by BE-MSS appears to have been largely secured. Similarly, all districts/cities can show that they have plans to support schools/madrasahs in the development and implementation of the required curriculum.</p>

The International Standard School programme was designed to test a model for developing high-quality Indonesian schools that develop strong creative thinking and problem solving skills among their students, meeting international standards. While schools and communities are generally positive about the programme, the study finds that academic performance of RSBI students is not significantly better than that of their peers at non-RBSI schools. Junior secondary-level RSBI students clearly outperform non-RSBI junior secondary students. However, the performance of senior secondary RSBI students on the national examination is found to be just 1-2% higher than the national average. Moreover, comparison with similar &#39;A&#39; accredited non-RSBI secondary schools shows little difference in scores and, in a few cases, non-RSBI outperform RSBI. Given that RSBI schools are found to be four times more costly to run than non-RSBI schools, the report concludes that the programme cannot be considered cost effective. In addition, the study finds that RSBI disproportionately serve middle- and upper-income families and often fail to meet the required quota of 20% enrolment of students from low-income families. On average, just 12% of RSBI students come from low-income families. Since the publication of this report the International Standard School programme has been terminated.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">This evaluation found 1339 RSBI schools across all 33 provinces but with 57% located in Java and with very few in more remote areas. No schools have achieved all the compliance requirements needed to reach international standard due to contextual barriers and constraints. While schools and communities are generally positive about the programme, the study finds that academic performance of RSBI students is not significantly better than that of their peers at non-RBSI schools. Parents contribute 68% of RSBI investment cost. Levying school fees on parents is necessary to ensuring sufficient funds are available for compliance with standards. However, the current fee structure is likely a disincentive for schools to improve access to low income, scholarship supported students; schools are far below reaching the 20% quota of low income students.</p>","<ul><li>Removing English as medium of instruction while teaching it as a compulsory subject and removing formal requirements for OECD or other developed country accreditation and curriculum adoption while including OECD or other country curriculum as a reference curriculum.</li><li>Levying a ceiling on parent contributions to offset the imbalance of the different socio-economic population groups in schools.</li><li>Freezing government infrastructure funding and implementing a comprehensive infrastructure needs assessment aligned to a minimum standard.</li><li>Providing vouchers for low-income students to participate in extracurricular activities.</li><li>Developing capacity building at the provincial and district levels to help officials fully understand the regulation and gain the necessary skills to support implementation.</li></ul>","Evaluasi Sekolah Bertaraf Internasional (RSBI)","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Laporan ini memaparkan hasil evaluasi terhadap Rintisan Sekolah Bertaraf Internasional (RSBI), yang ditetapkan pertama kali oleh Undang-Undang Pendidikan Nasional tahun 2003.

"115","Development of Quality Assurance System for Early Childhood Education","Study-on-Early-Childhood-Education-Quality-Assurance-Systems","<p style=""text-align:justify"">This short preliminary study was conducted over 72 days in four selected districts, namely Sukabumi in West Java, Pringsewu in Lampung, Banjar in South Kalimantan, and West Sumba in NTT. In addition to direct visits to the field, this study also included a literature review of the implementation of quality assurance systems in other countries. This preliminary study focuses more on non-formal ECE provision than on formal ECE provision. Quality assurance (QA) refers to a systematic and effective process of checking to see whether a service being developed is meeting specified requirements or standards. In order to achieve the ultimate goal of the early childhood education (ECE) program -- to improve the capacity of children (from birth to 6 years of age) to develop and learn -- ECE services should be of high quality and the providers need to be held accountable for such quality. However, the provision of high-quality ECE services is still a major challenge facing Indonesia. The establishment of an effective quality assurance system is critical. The initial step for the development of such a system has already been taken in the form of the regulatory framework from the constitution itself to government, presidential and ministerial regulations and the ministry&#39;s strategic plan as well as the establishing of national standards for ECE services. The study is particularly timely since the establishment of a Directorate General of Early Childhood Education and Community Education (DGPAUD DIKMAS) in the restructuring of MoEC leaves the way open for a consideration of how the critical function of quality assurance of ECE is best facilitated and structured under the new organizational arrangement and how the central government should link with the district and community levels in the implementation of quality assurance. Policy options are provided in light of the study&#39;s findings.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">There is a strong legal basis for the implementation of quality assurance in early childhood education. However, co-ordination in the implementation of ECE quality assurance between PPMP and the other units has not been optimal. Overlapping responsibilities of different levels of government has hampered efficient functioning of the system. Reorganization of MoEC has caused changes that could risk development of an effective quality assurance system. A significant proportion of both regulators and providers do not yet understand the regulations pertaining to quality assurance. Just 60% of regulators and less than 50% of ECE providers understand the regulations. Many non-formal ECE institutions have been unable to meet all of the eight national standards. The main constraints in meeting the standards as identified by the study team include the poor quality of ECE educators, a lack of adequate infrastructure and facilities and a lack of adequate financing of services. Close to 80% of parents believe that ECE attendance has improved their child's cognitive skills, while nearly 70% think that attendance has had a positive effect on social skills.</p><p style=""text-align:justify"">NOTE: During the course of this study, the Board of Human Resources Development (HRD in Education) was disbanded, including the Centre for Quality Assurance. This restructuring poses further challenges for addressing the problems of fragmentation alluded to in this report, since the organisational roles and responsibilities for quality assurance in ECD and other educations subsectors are not currently explicitly assigned under the restructuring.</p>","<ul><li>Central government needs to provide practical and easy-to-understand technical guidelines (operational procedures) for everyone involved in quality assurance at all levels of government, especially in district level government bodies and education units.</li><li>Quality assurance bodies at each level of government (central, provincial and district) need to implement socialization activities relating to multiple aspects of ECE quality assurance, including the laws and regulations, policies and programs.</li><li>A capacity building and technical assistance program for officials and stakeholders concerned with ECE quality assurance at the provincial and district levels of local government level should be developed and co-ordinated at the central level.</li><li>Provincial and district-level authorities need to undertake mapping of non- formal ECE quality at their respective levels. None of non-formal ECE centres in the study locus has been accredited and this means that none of the centres have received the initial quality assessment that is part of accreditation process.</li></ul>","Pengembangan Sistem Penjaminan Mutu Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Studi pendahuluan singkat ini dilakukan selama 72 hari di empat kabupaten yang dipilih, yaitu Sukabumi di Jawa Barat, Pringsewu di Lampung, Banjar di Kalimantan Selatan, dan Sumba Barat di NTT. Selain kunjungan langsung ke lapangan, penelitian ini juga dilakukan dengan tinjauan literatur pada penerapan sistem jaminan mutu di negara lain. Studi pendahuluan ini lebih fokus pada penyediaan pendidikan anak usia dini (PAUD) non-formal dibanding formal. Penjaminan mutu (QA) merupakan proses yang sistematis dan efektif untuk memeriksa apakah layanan yang sedang dikembangkan memenuhi persyaratan atau standar yang ditentukan. Dalam rangka mencapai tujuan akhir PAUD - untuk meningkatkan kapasitas anak-anak (dari lahir sampai usia 6 tahun) untuk berkembang dan belajar â€“ pelayanan PAUD harus berkualitas dan penyedia harus bertanggung jawab atas pelayanan berkualitas tersebut. Namun, penyelenggaraan PAUD berkualitas masih merupakan permasalahan yang dihadapi di Indonesia. Pembentukan sistem QA yang efektif sangat penting. Langkah awal untuk pengembangan sistem tersebut sudah diambil dalam bentuk kerangka peraturan perundang-undangan pemerintah, presiden dan peraturan menteri dan rencana strategis kementerian serta penetapan standar nasional untuk layanan PAUD. Penelitian ini sangat tepat waktu karena pembentukan Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini dan Pendidikan Masyarakat (Dirjen PAUD DIKMAS) dalam restrukturisasi Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan mendorong upaya bagaimana fungsi penting jaminan mutu PAUD dapat difasilitasi dan diatur di bawah organisasi yang baru dan bagaimana pemerintah pusat menghubungkan kabupaten dan masyarakat dalam pelaksanaan penjaminan mutu.

The program of Support for Mother Tongue Based, Multi-Lingual Education (MTB-MLE) for Schools in Rural and Remote Areas of Papua has the following five main objectives. First, it is to design and assist with starting-up a pilot MTB-MLE Papuan Research Program. The pilot program would start in the school year 2015/16 and be implemented by the provincial and relevant district dinas and UNCEN (State University of Cendrawasih), in collaboration with educational foundations and NGOs, and selected development partners. The pilot program would evaluate the effectiveness of using a transitional MTB-MLE program in increasing learning outcomes among students in rural and remote primary schools over a 3-year period (e.g. as measured in terms of early grade reading and numeracy scores as well as other curriculum content). Second, it is to build the capacity of the newly established sub-division of Culture and Language in the Provincial Office of Education and Culture (P&amp;K Dinas Provinsi) concerning issues of MTB-MLE instruction and bridging from the mother tongue to the official language (Bahasa Indonesia) in the early years of elementary schools. Third, it is to provide technical and capacity development support to the provincial and district offices of Education and Culture in order to integrate the language community and school mapping process and findings within the education planning system of these offices. Fourth, it is to provide technical support and capacity development to UNCEN Faculty of Education and Teaching (FKIP/LPTK) in their &quot;FKIP Revitalization&quot; program that would include the reform of the four teacher training colleges (KPGs) in Papua and West Papua provinces to incorporate Papuan MTB-MLE. Last but not least, it is to provide organizational/logistical and technical support to ACDP in the dissemination of Strategic Planning Study (produced under ACDP 039) with a special focus on MTB-MLE, to district level offices of education and culture.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">The state of rural and remote education in Papua faces many challenges but the government has boldly committed itself to understanding the problems and re-visioned some of its programs to address the challenge. One of the educational options being explored is a mother tongue based multilingual education (MTB-MLE) approach for rural and remote communities whose children speak little or no Indonesian.</p><p style=""text-align:justify"">The study found that one of the primary differences between urban and rural children in the Lanny Jaya Kabupaten is language use. As soon as one moves outside of the urban area of Tiom, only 1% of the population use Indonesian as their language of communication and 90% use Lani language, with 3.3% mixing the two languages. From the Snapshot of School Management Effectiveness student questionnaire, the study found that Bahasa Indonesia is very much a secondary language in the baseline population of students in rural and remote area of Lanny Jaya regency, and a weak one at that. Lani/Dani is the first language of almost all of the children so most are entering school with, at best, very rudimentary proficiency. The study's survey of language use in the classroom in the most rural and remote areas, however, finds that almost 65% of the teachers surveyed choose to use a language the students find difficult and only 20% use the language the students find easy. This is linked to findings from a survey of early grade reading abilities of children in Lanny Jaya indicate that, compared to peers in Indonesia, Lani children score about 80% less than the national average. Proficiency in Bahasa Indonesia was measured by means of a listening comprehension task and three separate vocabulary assessments. The rates of progress of Lani children observed between grades 2 and 3 suggest that the rate of skill development in literacy will not reach national grade 2 norms until grade 4 or 5 (closer to 5 than 4).</p><p style=""text-align:justify"">One of the primary impediment to the revitalization of the Teacher Colleges (Kolese Pendidikan Guru or KPG) in Papua to produce quality teachers able to resolve the literacy crisis issue is the need for its structural change.</p><p style=""text-align:justify"">While investigating the relationship between literacy and Indonesian language ability among Lani children, the study found that there is evidence that teachers in some of the schools may be putting more instructional time in teaching Bahasa Indonesia than in teaching literacy, and that there is huge variation among the schools in terms of achievement in the remote areas. Further, the SSME questionnaire found that communities in the area researched are very traditional in terms of standards of living and economic development, and school-based education in many communities researched in fact lacks the same level of urgency and importance seen in towns and cities where education is important to survival and job security.</p><p style=""text-align:justify"">The study also found absenteeism to be a significant issue. High rates of absenteeism (of students) in low quality schools does not seem to have as much negative impact as it does in higher performing schools.</p>","<p style=""text-align:justify"">MTB-MLE:</p><ul><li>Quickly Expand MTB-MLE to other Languages at UNCEN, work with NGOs to expand MTB-MLE, add a MTB-MLE course in the KPG curriculum and Integrate HIMPAUDNI for Professional Development in rural and remote Schools</li><li>Focus the elementary school curriculum on four main subjects (reading, writing, mathematics, and social studies)</li><li>Develop a MTB-MLE Department in Lanny Jaya (curriculum monitoring, teachers, professional development etc.) and ensure effective planning takes place between all departments related to MTB-MLE (for example, Elementary Education, Center for Language, and Curriculum Development units of the District and Province Education Offices as well as at UNCEN)</li><li>Develop a graduate study program (leading to M.A. or M.Ed.) in Rural and Remote Education at UNCEN</li><li>Work with communities to make strong Komite Sekolahs and 'Sekolah Kampungs'KPG Development:</li><li>Have each for the four existing Kolese Pendidikan Guru (KPG0 become an independent institution</li><li>Form an umbrella organization under which the KPGs will function as one institution offering S1 degrees in elementary and preschool education</li><li>Give the KPGs a higher-level representation at UNCEN (i.e. separate Dean), to ensure their voice is heard</li></ul>","Dukungan bagi Pendidikan Multi Bahasa Berbasis Bahasa Ibu (PMB-BBI) di Sekolah-Sekolah di Pedesaan dan Derah Terpencil di Papua ","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Tujuan pengembangan Pendidikan Multi Bahasa Berbasis Bahasa Ibu (PMB-BBI) untuk Sekolah di Pedesaan dan Terpencil di Papua, dalam meningkatkan kualitas, relevansi dan pemerataan pengajaran dan pembelajaran pendidikan dasar di daerah pedesaan dan terpencil Tanah Papua, melalui peningkatan kapasitas dalam mengembangkan dan menerapkan PMB-BBI dengan tepat dan efektif.

The Presidential Decree stipulates a hierarchy of 9 qualification levels to enable equivalency of the outcomes of formal education, non-formal, informal, or work experiences. The current stage of implementation of IQF varies among different sectors in Indonesia. Although certification is common in vocational stream such as polytechnics, implementing learning outcome is relatively new in higher education. This study finds that the development of qualification framework among the three main players, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Manpower, and the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, is segmented. In various sectors, it is found that learning outcomes defined by providers for qualifications are at odd with the competencies required by employers.

The Government of Indonesia (represented by the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Religious Affairs and 
the Ministry of National Development Planning/ BAPPENAS, the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), 
the European Union (EU) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have established the Analytical and Capacity Development 
Partnership (ACDP) as a facility to promote policy dialogue and institutional and organizational reform of the education sector 
to underpin policy implementation and help reduce disparities in provincial and district education performance.  The facility 
is an integral part of the Education Sector Support Program (ESSP) which consists of EU sector budget support with agreed 
arrangements for results-led grant disbursement, and earmarked policy and program-led AusAID sector development grant 
support consisting of a school infrastructure program, a nationwide district and school management development program 
and a program to accelerate the GOIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accreditation of private Islamic schools.  This report has been prepared with grant support

The study uses a mixture of literature review, cases study, group discussion and interviews with stakeholders from universities, local and central government and industry to assess the state of partnerships, identify issues and provide policy options. The study finds that universities, industry and government tend to act as three independent spheres and identifies only a small number of examples of effective cooperation among the three. A lack of understanding and mutual trust across the sectors is found to be a fundamental constraint to greater co-operation. While the report notes that neither universities, nor industry, nor government currently possess the capacity to lead the development of Indonesia&#39;s innovation system, it concludes that universities have the greatest potential to spearhead partnerships. A number of recommendations for promoting greater co-operation between the three sets of institutions are made.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">Universities, industry and government tend to act as three independent spheres and there are only a small number of examples of effective cooperation among the three. Indonesia spends just 0.08% of GDP on research and development, a significantly smaller proportion than Malaysia, India and China.

Studi ini dilakukan dengan menggabungkan berbagai telaah literatur, studi kasus, diskusi kelompok dan wawancara dengan para pemangku kepentingan yakni wakil-wakil dari universitas, pemerintah daerah dan pusat, serta kalangan industri. Tujuannya adalah untuk mengkaji kondisi kemitraan saat ini, mengidentifikasi permasalahan dan mengemukakan berbagai pilihan kebijakan. Penelitian ini menemukan bahwa universitas, industri dan pemerintah cenderung bertindak sebagai tiga pihak yang independen dan hanya menemukan sedikit contoh kerjasama yang efektif di antara ketiganya. Indonesia hanya mengalokasikan 0,08% dari Produk Domestik Bruto-nya untuk kegiatan penelitian dan pengembangan, sebuah angka yang secara signifikan kecil jika dibandingkan dengan Malaysia, India dan China. Pemerintah Indonesia bahkan hanya bertanggungjawab atas hampir separuh dari porsi pembelanjaan tersebut, sementara investasi bagi kegiatan LitBang di negara-negara Asia lain tampak terus meningkat. Rendahnya pemahaman dan rasa saling percaya antar kalangan dari berbagai sektor tampak menjadi kendala utama bagi terwujudnya kerjasama yang lebih luas.

The Survey of Adult Skills, a product of the OECD Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), was designed to provide insights into the availability of some of these key skills in society and how they are used at work and at home. The first survey of its kind, it directly measures proficiency in several information-processing skills "" namely literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments. This volume reports results from the 24 countries and regions that participated in the first round of the survey in 2011-12 (first published in OECD Skills Outlook 2013: First Results from the Survey of Adult Skills) and from the nine additional countries that participated in the second round in 2014-15 (Chile, Greece, Indonesia [Jakarta], Israel, Lithuania, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia and Turkey). It describes adults&#39; proficiency in the three information-processing skills assessed, and examines how skills proficiency is related to labour market and social outcomes. Another related report, The Survey of Adult Skills: Reader&#39;s Companion, Second Edition, describes the design and methodology of the survey and its relationship to other international assessments of young students and adults.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">The support from ACDP in successfully implementing the OECD Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) Survey in Jakarta and submitting data to the PIAAC Consortia has enabled Indonesia, through MoEC, to participate in the program for the first time. Indonesia (Jakarta) is one of nine countries that participated in the second round of the survey in 2014-15 along with 24 countries participating in the first round in 2011-12. An ACDP IDC consortia firm was recruited to provide support to the MoEC PIAAC Team to prepare for and implement the PIAAC Main Survey in Jakarta. This comprised administrative support in arranging and funding preparatory workshops, and recruitment of personnel to assist with conducting the survey.</p><p style=""text-align:justify"">The Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) assesses the proficiency of 16-65 year-olds in literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments. These are 'key information-processing skills' that are relevant to adults in many social contexts and work situations, and necessary for fully integrating and participating in the labour market, education and training, and social and civic life. The Indonesian instruments contained 49 literacy items and 49 numeracy items.</p><p style=""text-align:justify"">The Survey of Adult Skills measures proficiency in literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments among 16 to 65 year-olds. It finds that the variation in average scores in the three domains, across countries, is substantial. For instance, in terms of average adult proficiency in literacy, Jakarta (Indonesia) was the lowest-scoring economy, with Japan as the highest scoring country and a difference of 97 points in between. The average scores of adults in Jakarta (Indonesia) are the lowest among participating countries/economies in literacy and the second lowest in numeracy.</p><p style=""text-align:justify"">In almost all countries/economies, a sizeable proportion of adults has poor reading skills (18.9% of adults, on average) and poor numeracy skills (22.7% of adults, on average). Low-skilled adults represent a significant proportion of the population in all countries/economies. At least one in ten adults is proficient at or below Level 1 in literacy or numeracy in all countries in the study except Japan; more than one in two adults in Chile and Jakarta (Indonesia) score at these levels in literacy. Higher literacy proficiency is associated with higher wages. The increase in wages associated with a one standard deviation rise in years of education (around 3.2 years) range from less than 7% in Sweden to more than 20% in Chile, Jakarta (Indonesia), Slovenia, Turkey and the United States, and more than 30% in Singapore.</p><p style=""text-align:justify"">In many countries, leaving education before earning an upper secondary qualification is a significant and worrying phenomenon.

In addition, nearly half of adults have low proficiency in problem solving in technology- rich environments.</p><p style=""text-align:justify"">In most countries there is significant difference in numeracy proficiency between men and women.

SKILLS MATTER: FURTHER RESULTS FROM THE SURVEY OF ADULT SKILLS Ã‚Â© OECD 2016 3

In a world in which millions of people are unemployed while many employers complain that they cannot find 
qualified workers something is obviously out of balance. One of those issues is the match between the supply of and 
demand for skills. Governments need a clearer picture, not only of how labour markets are changing, but of how well-
equipped their citizens are to participate in, and benefit from, increasingly knowledge-based economies. The Survey 
of Adult Skills, a product of the OECD Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), 
is providing that picture. It captures information about adultsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ proficiency in literacy, numeracy and problem-solving 
skills, and whether and how those skills are used on the job and throughout life.

Skills Matter: Further Results from the Survey of Adult Skills expands on the data and analysis examined in the OECD 
Skills Outlook 2013: First Results from the Survey of Adult Skills by including data from nine additional countries that 
conducted the survey in 2014-15. The results show that poor skills severely limit peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s access to better-paying 
and more rewarding jobs. The distribution of skills also has significant implications for how the benefits of economic 
growth are shared within societies. Put simply, where large shares of adults have poor skills, it becomes difficult to 
introduce productivity-enhancing technologies and new ways of working, which in turn stalls improvements in living 
standards. Importantly, the results show that skills affect more than earnings and employment. In all countries, adults 
with lower skills are far more likely than those with better literacy skills to report poor health, to perceive themselves 
as objects rather than actors in political processes, and to have less trust in others. 

The report also finds that acquiring relevant skills is certainly key, but may not be enough to integrate successfully in 
the labour market. Skills must be used productively, not only to keep them from atrophying, but also to reap some 
of the intangible benefits of skills proficiency that contribute to adultsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ general well-being. For example, this report 
shows that the intensity with which workers use their information-processing skills in their jobs is related to the 
likelihood of being satisfied at work. 

Going forward, the OECD is working with governments to develop national skills strategies that ensure that their 
citizens are equipped with the right skills for 21st-century economies and use those skills productively. We know that 
skills matter for both workers and employers; now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to get the balance right.

ReaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide
Data underlying the figures
Detailed data tables corresponding to the figures presented in the main body of the report can be found in AnnexÃ‚Â A. 
These figures and tables are numbered according to the corresponding chapters, and include an abbreviation in 
brackets to denote one of the three direct measures of skills for which there are data in the Survey of Adult Skills 
(PIAAC) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ literacy (L), numeracy (N) and problem solving in technology-rich environments (P). As an example, 
Figure 3.1 (L) denotes the first figure in Chapter 3 based on the literacy scale and it has Table A3.1 (L) as a 
corresponding data table in Annex A.

Annex B includes other detailed data tables that either correspond to figures included in boxes or to citations in 
the main body of the report, but for which no figure was provided. 

Unless otherwise stated, the population underlying each of the figures and tables covers adults aged 16-65.

Web package
Figures included in the report and the corresponding data tables contained in Annex A and B present data for only 
one of the three direct measures of skills, either literacy (L), numeracy (N) or problem solving in technology-rich 
environments (P). A more complete set of data tables can be found at www.oecd.org/site/piaac/. This web package 
includes all the figures and tables included in the report as well as data tables for the other skills domains referred 
to but not examined in the report. The package consists of ExcelÃ‚Â® workbooks that can be viewed and downloaded 
by chapter.

StatLinks
A StatLink URL address is provided under each figure and table. Readers using the pdf version of the report 
can simply click on the relevant StatLinks url to either open or download an ExcelÃ‚Â® workbook containing the 
corresponding figures and tables. Readers of the print version can access the ExcelÃ‚Â® workbook by typing the 
StatLink address in their Internet browser.

Calculating international averages (means)
Most figures and tables presented in this report and in the web package include an OECD average in addition to values 
for individual countries or sub-national entities. The average in each figure or table corresponds to the arithmetic 
mean of the respective estimates for each of the OECD countries or sub-national entities included in the figure or 
table. In the calculation of the OECD average, England (United Kingdom) and Northern Ireland (UnitedÃ‚Â Kingdom) 
are treated as separate entities. Cyprus*, Jakarta (Indonesia), Lithuania, and the RussianÃ‚Â Federation** and Singapore 
are not included in the OECD averages presented in any of the figures or tables.

Standard error (S.E.)
The statistical estimates presented in this report are based on samples of adults, rather than values that could be 
calculated if every person in the target population in every country had answered every question. Therefore, each 
estimate has a degree of uncertainty associated with sampling and measurement error, which can be expressed 
as a standard error. The use of confidence intervals provides a way to make inferences about the population 
means and proportions in a manner that reflects the uncertainty associated with the sample estimates. In this 
report, confidence intervals are stated at 95% confidence level. In other words, the result for the corresponding 
population would lie within the confidence interval in 95 out of 100 replications of the measurement on different 
samples drawn from the same population.

Statistical significance
Differences considered to be statistically significant from either zero or between estimates are based on the 5% 
level of significance, unless otherwise stated. In the figures, statistically significant estimates are denoted in a 
darker tone.

Country coverage
This publication features data on 28 OECD countries (or regions within these countries): Australia, Austria, Belgium, 
Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,*** Ireland, Israel, Italy, 
Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, 
Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. In Belgium, data was collected in the Flanders region only. In the 
United Kingdom, data was collected in England and Northern Ireland only. In addition, fiveÃ‚Â countries that are not 
members of the OECD participated in the survey: Cyprus,* Jakarta (Indonesia), Lithuania, the RussianÃ‚Â Federation** 
and Singapore. Data estimates for England (United Kingdom) and Northern Ireland (UnitedÃ‚Â Kingdom) are presented 
separately.

The names of the countries participating in Round 2 of the Survey of Adult Skills are presented in blue in all figures 
and tables.

Rounding
Data estimates, including mean scores, proportions and standard errors, are generally rounded to one decimal 
place. Therefore, even if the value (0.0) is shown for standard errors, this does not necessarily imply that the 
standard error is zero, but that it is smaller than 0.05.

Education levels
The classification of levels of education is based on the International Standard Classification of Education 
(ISCEDÃ‚Â 1997). A revised version of ISCED (ISCED 2011) was adopted by the UNESCO General Conference at its 
36th session in November 2011 (UIS, 2012). Member States have applied ISCED 2011 in the reporting of their 
education statistics from 2014. Data on educational participation and attainment from Round 1 of the Survey of 
Adult Skills was coded using the ISECD 1997 classification. To maintain comparability with the data from RoundÃ‚Â 1, 
data from Round 2 has also been coded using ISCED 1997. 

Further documentation and resources

*Note regarding Cyprus
Note by Turkey
The information in this document with reference toÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“CyprusÃ¢â‚¬Â relates to the southern part of the Island. There 
is no single authority representing both Turkish and Greek Cypriot people on the Island. Turkey recognises the 
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Until a lasting and equitable solution is found within the context 
of the United Nations, Turkey shall preserve its position concerning the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cyprus issueÃ¢â‚¬Â.

Note by all the European Union Member States of the OECD and the European Union
The Republic of Cyprus is recognised by all members of the United Nations with the exception of Turkey. 
TheÃ‚Â  information in this document relates to the area under the effective control of the Government of the 
Republic of Cyprus. 

Throughout this report, including the main body, boxes and annexes, Cyprus is accompanied by a symbol referring 
to this note.

**Note regarding the Russian Federation
The sample for the Russian Federation does not include the population of the Moscow municipal area. The data 
published, therefore, do not represent the entire resident population agedÃ‚Â 16-65 in the Russian Federation but 
rather the population of the Russian Federation excluding the population residing in the Moscow municipal area. 
More detailed information regarding the data from the Russian Federation as well as that of other countries can be 
found in the Technical Report of the Survey of Adult Skills, Second Edition (OECD, forthcoming).

***Note regarding Greece
The data for Greece include a large number of cases (1Ã‚Â 032) in which there are responses to the background 
questionnaire but where responses to the assessment are missing. Proficiency scores have been estimated for these 
respondents based on their responses to the background questionnaire and the population model used to estimate 
plausible values for responses missing by design derived from the remaining 3Ã‚Â 893 cases. More details can be 
found in the Technical Report of the Survey of Adult Skills, Second Edition (OECD, forthcoming).

SKILLS MATTER: FURTHER RESULTS FROM THE SURVEY OF ADULT SKILLS Ã‚Â© OECD 2016 17

The capacity to manage information and solve problems using computers is becoming a necessity as ICT applications 
permeate the workplace, the classroom and lecture hall, the home, and social interaction more generally. The Survey of 
Adult Skills, a product of the OECD Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), was 
designed to measure adultsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ proficiency in several key information-processing skills, namely literacy, numeracy and 
problem solving in technology-rich environments. Adults who are highly proficient in the skills measured by the survey 
are likely to be able to make the most of the opportunities created by the technological and structural changes modern 
societies are going through. Those who struggle to use new technologies are at greater risk of losing out.

The results from the first round of the survey, covering 24 countries and economies, were reported in the OECD Skills 
Outlook 2013: FirstÃ‚Â Results from the Survey of Adult Skills. Another nine countries and economies collected data during 
2014-15. ThisÃ‚Â report presents the main findings for all 33 countries and economies that participated in the study over the 
two rounds. It finds substantial variation across countries/economies in adultsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ average proficiency in the three domains 
assessed. More than 80 score points separate the highest- and lowest-scoring countries in literacy and numeracy, 
although many countries and economies score within a relatively close range of each other. Within countries and 
economies, proficiency scores in literacy and numeracy vary considerably: on average, 62 score points separate the 25% 
of adults who attained the highest and lowest scores in literacy; in numeracy, 68 score points separate those two groups.

In almost all countries/economies, a sizeable proportion of adults (18.5% of adults, on average) has poor reading skills 
and poor numeracy skills (22.7% of adults, on average). Around one in four adults has no or only limited experience with 
computers or lacks confidence in their ability to use computers. In addition, nearly one in two adults is proficient only 
at or below Level 1 in problem solving in technology-rich environments. This adult can only use familiar applications to 
solve problems that involve few steps and explicit criteria, such as sorting e-mails into pre-existing folders.

SKILLS PROFICIENCY AND DEMOGRAPHICS
The survey finds that, in the cohorts examined, proficiency in literacy and numeracy peaks at around age 30, while 
proficiency in problem solving in technology-rich environments peaks at around age 25. On average, older adults 
(55-65Ã‚Â year-olds) score around 30Ã‚Â score points lower in literacy than 25-34 year-olds. A substantial share of age-related 
differences in proficiency is associated with other individual characteristics, particularly adultsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ level of educational 
attainment. This is likely because highly proficient adults are more likely to participate in higher levels of education, and 
because longer periods of study provide the opportunity to develop higher levels proficiency in information-processing skills. 

ParentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ educational background, a proxy for socio-economic status, exerts a significant influence on adultsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ proficiency 
in literacy. Having at least one parent with tertiary qualifications is associated with a 40 score-point advantage over 
adults with neither parent having attained an upper secondary degree. Gender gaps in proficiency Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which are negligible 
in literacy and average around 10 score points, in favour of men, in numeracy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are more pronounced among older 
adults. This could reflect either the fact that gender gaps in educational attainment are wider among older adults, or that 
womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s numeracy skills depreciate more over time, possibly because they participate less in the labour market.

PROFICIENCY AND THE LABOUR MARKET 
Adults with higher proficiency in literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments tend to have 
better outcomes in the labour market than their less-proficient peers. They have greater chances of being employed and, 
if employed, of earning higher wages. Across the countries that participated in the Survey of Adult Skills, an adult who 
scores one standard deviation higher than another on the literacy scale (around 48 score points) is 0.8 percentage point 
more likely to be employed than unemployed, on average, after accounting for other factors, including educational 
attainment. And an increase of one standard deviation in literacy proficiency is associated with a 6% increase in wages, 
on average across the 33 participating countries and economies. 

Workers who use information-processing skills more intensely in their jobs also tend to earn higher wages, even 
after accounting for differences in educational attainment and skills proficiency. Writing and problem solving are the 
skills most frequently used at work; reading skills follow close behind, while numeracy and ICT skills are least used.  

Executive summary



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

18 Ã‚Â© OECD 2016 SKILLS MATTER: FURTHER RESULTS FROM THE SURVEY OF ADULT SKILLS

On average across the countries/economies that participated in the survey, the intensity with which workers use their 
information-processing skills in their jobs is also related to the likelihood of being extremely satisfied at work, even 
after taking into account proficiency, educational attainment, gross hourly wages and a number of socio-demographic 
characteristics. The way work is organised Ã¢â‚¬â€œ through implementing High-Performance Work Practices like team work, 
autonomy, task discretion, mentoring, job rotation and applying new learning Ã¢â‚¬â€œ can increase the frequency with which 
skills are used at work.

SKILLS AND THE ENGAGED CITIZEN
Proficiency in information-processing skills is positively associated with many aspects of individual well-being, notably 
health, beliefs about oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impact on the political process, trust in others, and participation in volunteer or associative 
activities. In most countries, adults who scored at lower levels of proficiency in literacy were more likely than those who 
scored at high levels to have reported poor health, that they have little impact on the political process, and that they do 
not participate in associative or volunteer activities. Individuals with lower proficiency were also more likely than those 
with higher proficiency to have reported less trust in others. 

Results from the survey show clearly that what people know and what they do with what they know have a major 
impact on their life chances. Skills have become the global currency of 21st-century economies; but this Ã¢â‚¬Å“currencyÃ¢â‚¬Â 
can depreciate as the requirements of labour markets evolve and individuals lose the skills they do not use. To ensure 
that people acquire the right skills and that economies and societies make good use of those skills, a concerted effort 
is needed by governments, which design financial incentives and favourable tax policies that are conducive to skills 
development; education systems, which foster entrepreneurship and offer vocational training; employers, who invest 
in learning and can motivate workers to put more of their skills to use; labour unions, which ensure that investments in 
training result in better-quality jobs and higher salaries; and individuals, who take advantage of learning opportunities 
and deploy their skills at work and in everyday life. The OECD is working with many of the countries who participated 
in the survey to develop national skills strategies that bring all of these players together to make this happen.

Box 1.1 Key facts concerning the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC)

What PIAAC assesses 
The Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) assesses the proficiency of 16-65Ã‚Â year-olds in literacy, numeracy and problem 
solving in technology-rich environments. These are Ã¢â‚¬Å“key information-processing skillsÃ¢â‚¬Â that are relevant to adults 
in many social contexts and work situations, and necessary for fully integrating and participating in the labour 
market, education and training, and social and civic life.

In addition, the survey collects a range of information on the reading- and numeracy-related activities of 
respondents, the use of information and communication technologies at work and in everyday life, and on the 
practice of a range of other generic skills, such as collaborating with others and organising oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time, required 
of individuals in their work. Respondents are also asked whether their skills and qualifications match their work 
requirements and whether they have autonomy over key aspects of their work. 

Methods
The Survey of Adults Skills was conducted over two rounds of data collection.  

In the first round, around 166 000 adults aged 16-65Ã‚Â years in 24Ã‚Â countries/economies were surveyed. In 21Ã‚Â countriesÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€œ

Underlying this goal are three key principles. First, the plans outlined in the Medium Term Development Plan (RPJM) must be economically feasible and support strong economic growth. Second, the development path over the next five years must be socially acceptable. It will need to improve social harmony, encourage community participation and narrow inequalities across regions and between socio-economic groups. A third key principle underlying the RPJM is the need for greater sustainability and the need to protect the environment for future generations. A strong, vibrant and good quality education system can support all of these underlying principles. Part 1 of this background study focuses on basic education, early childhood, as well as access and quality. Part 2 focuses on senior secondary, vocational and higher education, as well as education financing and governance.</p>

"124","Education Governance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ National Partnerships for Education Study","Education-Governance-Study","<p style=""text-align:justify"">This study placed the strategic options for a new partnership for education within the context of perceived structural inconsistencies affecting governance of education in Indonesia. Thus the analysis first addressed these perceived structural inconsistencies in order to identify the actual situation as a basis for providing options to address these conditions. The analysis of perceived structural inconsistency between decentralization and national unity is based on the legal and regulatory analysis activity as well as the international comparison activity. The analysis indicates that the perceived structural inconsistencies are, to some degree, the result of historical misunderstanding of the objectives of decentralization. Nevertheless, the analysis also shows that Indonesian decentralization practices are consistent with international good practice.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">The report found three types of structural inconsistencies that affect education governance. The inconsistencies are classified as i) structural inconsistency of decentralization vis-'-vis national unity, ii) structural inconsistency in employment and deployment of teachers, iii) structural inconsistency in the mismatch between sources of funding and responsibility for activities. Analysis of the perceived structural inconsistencies in teacher employment and unemployment demonstrates three important points. First, any discussion of oversupply of teachers derived from 'national' student/teacher ratios using macro level data must be carefully defined as to which teachers are intended (civil service, various types of contracts, etc.). The second feature of the teacher employment inconsistency is the very central role played by staffing rules (minimum service standards MSS, accreditation rules, etc.). The frequently stated 'stylized fact' that districts try to hire more civil service teachers in order to increase their budget allocations from the national budget is shown to be inaccurate. Finally, it is apparent that civil service reforms enacted since 2011, if enforced effectively, will address the general issue of civil service teacher planning and recruitment. Analysis of the perceived structural inconsistencies between funding and management shows that the perceived inconsistencies are based on misunderstanding of the funding mechanisms, in particular confusion between flows of funds through (district) budgets and funds over which districts have decision making authority. The reforms of the national planning and budgeting system have addressed most of the issues with the exception of adequate funding for maintenance of physical structures.</p>","<ul><li>Extending performance based budget system to provinces and districts with regional sectoral performance targets derived from central sectoral targets, as well as effective monitoring of district performance.</li><li>Enforcing civil service reform to ensure new teacher hires are deployed based on need and integrating contract teachers into the formal system.</li><li>Encouraging districts to use alternative delivery mechanisms in order to achieve participation rates in remote and sparsely populated area.</li><li>Ministry of Finance to publish general allocation fund (DAU) broken down into basic and scal gap allocations.</li><li>Developing simple operational guidelines for school maintenance planning and implementation as part of the SBM materials.</li><li>Providing additional BOS-for- maintenance supplement to BOS, using MoF's 'quadrant' system to determine priorities.</li></ul>","Tata Kelola Pendidikan - Kemitraan Nasional untuk Studi Pendidikan ","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Studi ini merekomendasikan opsi-opsi strategis untuk sebuah kemitraan baru dalam tata kelola pendidikan dalam konteks inkonsistensi-inkonsistensi struktural yang mempengaruhi tata kelola pendidikan di Indonesia.

One of the main foci in this study is on the vocational teachers. Despite sizable government investments in SMKs and reforms accompanied with decentralization, and some flexibility in program content across regions, the ability to plan, budget and finance the regional education system continues to cause problems. This study found that teacher quality issues were at least and probably more pressing than shortages among vocational teachers. A second major issue is located in the mismatch of curriculum and study program to skill demand. While the economic potential of districts surveyed was mostly reflected in the content of secondary vocational programs, the current set of courses are not always considered by school principals as meeting the needs of the community. This was especially true in the primary sector, in both agriculture (including fisheries and plantations) and mining, as well as in tourism. Thus there was often a mismatch between study programs and jobs taken upon graduation. Lastly, major study finding include another instance reflecting the lack of a dynamic interactions between SMK and local or regional businesses. The report lays out key areas for reform of the SMK Network.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">The quick expansion of SMK has created a number of problems and the quality of its graduates and investment in SMK do not seem to be increasing proportionately. This study found that the quality of vocational teachers is more prominent than the issue of teacher undersupply. One issue on SMK curriculum is the lack of relevancy between offered education programs and the needs of the community. Another issue is the misalignment of programs with the national standards and certification.

Meskipun pemerintah telah berinvestasi cukup besar untuk SMK dan dengan adanya reformasi yang disertai dengan desentralisasi serta fleksibilitas dalam isi program telah diberikan di seluruh daerah, kemampuan untuk merencanakan, menganggarkan dan membiayai sistem pendidikan daerah masih memiliki tantangan. Studi ini menemukan bahwa isu mutu guru mungkin lebih mendesak daripada kekurangan guru kejuruan. Masalah utama berikutnya adalah adanya ketidakcocokan kurikulum dan program studi dengan keterampilan yang dibutuhkan. Walaupun potensi ekonomi kabupaten yang disurvei sebagian besar tercermin dalam isi program menengah kejuruan, menurut kepala sekolah, pengajaran yang ditawarkan tidak semuanya dapat memenuhi kebutuhan masyarakat. Hal ini terlihat terutama di sektor primer, baik di bidang pertanian (termasuk perikanan dan perkebunan) dan pertambangan, serta pariwisata. Sehingga antara program studi dan pekerjaan yang diambil setelah lulus seringnya tidak sesuai.

The objectives of this scheme include the development of a scholarship system to benefit the poor; right-sizing the scholarship for each level of schooling; improving fund channeling and monitoring systems; institutional development and better definition of the roles and responsibilities of local government, schools and communities in the channeling, monitoring and evaluation of BSM Program implementation. A main feature of this scheme is the integration of support for poor students with the targeting and access mechanism developed by TNP2K. To support this program, MoEC was intended to implement a communications strategy with the roll-out of funds to overcome the incomplete take-up rate. This Rapid Assessment was carried out through ACDP to gather and analyze quantitative and qualitative data from the BSM fund disbursement process. This analysis resulted several policy options to improve the BSM program management and is expected to contribute to a more effective pro-poor education policy, by understanding; how accurate the targeting mechanism for identifying the poor and near-poor, whether the unit cost of the Scholarship component adequate, to what extent has problem in access to education been solved by BSM, what was the impact of this BSM program and what we can learn from this program to improve the provision of scholarships for the poor in the future.</p>

However, the impact of BSM is least at the elementary level, and children will go to SD/MI with or without BSM, with the exception of some cases in poor remote areas and in some urban areas. At the basic elementary level, the targeting of BSM appears to be more pressing than the amounts, especially for private madrasah. However, although specific quantitative data was not available for senior secondary, the qualitative data indicated that expenses are very high and the BSM at Rp1,200,000/year is not sufficient to cover the costs of fees and other expenses. There were almost universal complaints about BSM disbursement procedures. Late BSM funds distribution has a negative impact on the program because students need money at the beginning of the school year to buy uniforms, supplies, pay for transport and in some cases pay fees and tuition.

The purpose of the evaluation was to determine the efficiencey, effectiveness, relevance and impact of PPP in order to provide advice to the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA) on how to best prepare school principals. To meet this key objectvei, this evaluation has aimed to provide information on whether the PPP is effective in improving school leadership and the competencies of principals.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">Overall, the study showed that Indonesia's Principal Preparation Program (PPP) is very effective and relevant to participants and supervisors. The process of selection, recruitment and appointment of school principals are generally considered to be effective, and the quality and relevance of the training provided is considered to be high. One reported problem was the existence of some political and bureaucratic involvement in the identification of applicants and appointment of principals. A few other challenges identified in the study were that Regulation 28/2010 on conducting principal appointment is not implemented consistently across Indonesia, appointments to principal positions are occurring in some places without the principal having NUKS (principal number) and some graduates of PPP are not appointed to principal positions within two years of undertaking training. In addition, the accuracy of the records kept by LPPKS about the number of participants in PPP, the number of graduates with a NUKS, and the number of graduates who have been appointed as school principals, is inadequate.

The ICT vision in recent years has been increasingly focused on ensuring fully-integrated Internet interconnections across provincial offices, districts and schools, with high bandwidth fibre optic wireless broadband being available in accessible areas or with low bandwidth satellites operating wherever possible. Cluster-based ICT Centres involving digital learning lessons and professional development across schools; and strengthening ICT capacity for improving educational data management and information systems, are significant aspects of the strategy. For more remote locations, affirmative education through establishing small elementary schools within community learning centres, with learning of students and adults supported through provision of quality television programs, have all been important aspects of the educational vision. New pedagogical approaches for educational delivery underpin the Papuan vision for using ICTs in education. The key objectives of this study are: To measure the effectiveness of the TV-Edukasi (Education) (TV-E) and other ICT programs in the Province and to determine their impact on the learning outcomes of school children and adult learners To make recommendations to plan for further ICT in education initiatives. The study also involves three key research components, these being telecommunications and power infrastructure; ICT programs and implementation, and ICT impacts on adult and student learning.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">In addition to having initiated ICT programs such as TV Edukasi in schools, Papua has given 1135 schools ICT hardware and 1500 teachers professional development through the BPP ICT Centre. Most of these fledgling initiatives have received positive feedback from education practitioners and administrators. However, ICT is not being used regularly in schools in Papua. Only 30- 40% of survey respondents used TV-Edukasi channels and CDs/ DVDs. Only about 20% of students reported to have at least weekly use of ICTs, and about 73% of students had no Internet access at school. Reasons for low ICT usage include there being an absence of power, reliable internet service and/or hardware in Papua. In addition, teachers are often not trained to use ICT or to incorporate ICT in their curriculum. 20-30% of teachers and principals found ICT difficult to understand and 95% believed they needed to increase their own skills before being allowed to use ICT.</p>","<ul><li>Focus on careful implementation of ICT strategies to avoid pitfalls of the past in developing the use of ICT systematically.</li><li>Provide students a wider range of ICT hardware and a broader range of software and opportunities to use ICT by giving each school a budget allocation for procuring new equipment and for maintenance and repair.</li><li>Provide teachers and principals with opportunities for professional development to improve ICT use and build teaching and learning pedagogical skills.</li><li>Finding ways for providing sustainable power and a vastly improved telecommunications infrastructure.</li></ul>","Evaluasi TIK dalam Pendidikan di Provinsi Papua","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Penggunaan TIK dianggap sebagai strategi penting dalam mengangkat kualitas pengalaman pendidikan dan meningkatkan mutu hidup di Papua.

"136","Support to MOEC on Curriculum Reform","Support-to-MOEC-on-Curriculum-Reform","<p style=""text-align:justify"">The ultimate purpose of Support to Curriculum Reform is to improve the quality of instruction and learning in the classroom in schools with a specific focus on achieving an optimal balance between the development of &quot;Skills for the 21st Century&quot; with the objectives of enhancing employability and promoting lifelong learning, including the development of cognitive skills, as well as interpersonal and intra-personal skills for the development of student character and behavior. The purpose of this program is to develop the capacity of the Curriculum and Textbook Centre (Puskurbuk, Balitbang) for systemic and on-going monitoring, review and evaluation of the curriculum design and implementation process - to become a &quot;living curriculum&quot; responding to changes needed over time - as well as its coordination with textbook design, student assessment, and the supply and professional development of teachers. In the limited time available under ACDP, a number of strategic changes will be initiated to build the capacity of the M&amp;E function in Puskurbuk to support future sustainability in conducting continuous monitoring and review of curriculum and textbooks.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">Indonesia is in the process of revising and implementing a national curriculum for primary and secondary grades known as Curriculum 2013 or, K13, and the Centre for Curriculum and Textbooks (Puskurbuk) is leading the process. In 2016, a Rapid Review of K13 conducted led to a series of suggestions for revising materials and policies for implementation. In 2017, a subsequent collaborative project between Puskurbuk and the Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership, ACDP, led to deeper analyses of K13, the creation of tools for monitoring and evaluation, the design template of sample lesson plans, and consideration of other national curriculum models.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Monitoring and Evaluation</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The consultant team examined several evaluation tools used by Puskurbuk in the past and concluded that they were cumbersome and inefficient. The strategy employed was to design and create a few tools that would allow Puskurbuk staff to gather feedback from curriculum stakeholders around the country with relatively brief time spent gathering reactions from teachers, principals, parents, and students. Efforts were also made to ensure Puskurbuk staff would be able score and summarize the data efficiently and easily. During field visits to gather feedback on the M &amp; E tools, it was found that principals in the four selected sites had implemented K13 for 2-4 years so they were very familiar with the curriculum and challenges of implementation. In general, principals were positive about the changes included in K13 and said that students are more challenged by K13 and they become more confident students. They learn to use online searches and find resources for learning. Principals said teachers had greater administrative burdens, but they are learning about the internet and resources along with their students. Teachers need more training in IT, more access to computers, and more training on assessment. The materials are good but textbooks are not always available or affordable.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Sample Lesson Plan Templates</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Sample lesson plan templates with illustrative examples of lesson plans were designed and developed in collaboration with Puskurbuk to help teachers implement K13 by emphasising deep learning and focusing on: (a) learning progressions and the development of concepts and skills, (b) big ideas or core concepts in a discipline that are reflected in basic competencies, (c) active learning where students initiate and maintain inquiry and discussion, and (d) formative assessment so that teachers can focus instruction on each student's emerging knowledge. Key findings from the field include 1) teachers and principals feel they need more training to implement K13; 2) that there is a lack of quality books, teaching resources and facilities; and 3) teachers feel current assessment methods are confusing and not aligned.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Considerations of other National Curriculum Models</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">On 9 May 2017 the project team organized an educational conference in Jakarta on 'Effective Practices for Curriculum Reform in Asia'.

Ohn, Associate Professor Gyeongin National University of Education, South Korea, and Dr. Anita Rampal, Professor of Education, Delhi University, India. They discussed national curriculum reform and implementation in their countries with attention to implications for Indonesia. Themes of best practice included: reforms should be systematic and cohesive; collaboration and multiple stakeholder involvement in the planning and reform process; teachers require professional development support and ongoing training to adapt to changes in pedagogies and improving learning outcomes; data should be used to track progress, to report on outcomes and assess success and identify issues (longitudinal, demographic data); and education for all requires accessible, equitable and quality learning environments that reflect cultural diversity and provide all children the opportunity to learn.</p>","","Reformasi Kurikulum","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Tujuan akhir dari Reformasi Kurikulum adalah meningkatkan kualitas pembelajaran di dalam kelas dengan fokus khusus pada pencapaian keseimbangan optimal antara pengembangan â€œKeterampilan Abad ke-21â€ yang bertujuan untuk meningkatkan kemampuan kerja dan mempromosikan belajar sepanjang hayat, termasuk pengembangan keterampilan kognitif, interpersonal dan intra - personal dalam pengembangan karakter dan perilaku siswa.

This objective is premised on the important role of assessment in fulfilling a number of objectives: supporting effective teaching and learning in classrooms, providing reliable information on individual performance by which to select students for further stages in the education system or employment, as well as providing decision-makers with sample-based assessments of achievement levels in the education system as a whole at a particular age or grade levels. The program will provide support to the following components: (1) Assessment Frameworks, (2) Computer Based Testing Platform, (3) Classroom Based Assessment, (4) Secondary Analysis of Assessment Data and Reporting of Assessment Results.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">Since 2014, Indonesia's assessment system has been undergoing significant changes. Indonesia's new curriculum was implemented in 2013-2014 and the new content and structure of the curriculum has meant that there are now different classroom and school assessment requirements. Indonesia's national examinations, the Ujian Nasional (UN), has also undergone changes in order to reduce the high stakes nature of the exams and to minimise cheating. In December 2016, a moratorium of the UN was announced, however, this was subsequently withdrawn. It was also announced that an additional school-based exam, the USBN, would be conducted at Grades 6, 9 and 12. Indonesia's national monitoring assessment is also undergoing a period of change. The Indonesian National Assessment Program (INAP) has recently transitioned into the Asesmen Kompetensi Siswa Indonesia (AKSI), and it is planned that in the future the INAP/AKSI will focus on 21st century skills and will be solely administered as a computer-based test.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Puspendik, Indonesia's national assessment centre, is driving many of these changes and has committed to further enhancing Indonesia's assessment system. In 2015, the Education Sector Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) 029 program began to support the development of a world class assessment program in Indonesia, providing support to Puspendik between February 2015 and March 2016 (Phase 1), and also between June 2016 and May 2017 (Phase 2). The overall goal of the ACDP 029 project was to develop a Roadmap to a world class assessment system in Indonesia and 'to contribute to improving the quality of student learning outcomes through enhancing the reliability, validity and efficiency of assessment systems at both national and school levels' (from Term of Reference).</p>

The purpose of this study is to contribute towards the development of evidence-based policy and strategy for the provision of affordable, sustainable, well-coordinated, high quality, and equitable Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) services, particularly for marginalized populations. The study will use a critical selection of findings and recommendations from the many recent analytical studies and reports as well as from its own field surveys and case studies, to support the following two key MoEC initiatives: (1) the development of a Road Map for a one year &rdquo;Quality Pre-Primary Education for All&rdquo; program throughout Indonesia, as proposed by the Directorate of ECCE; and (2) the development of a supporting program of &rdquo;Quality Parenting Education&rdquo; for parents and caregivers of children of 0 to 6 years of age that can provide communities with the necessary knowledge, attitudes and skills to support children&rsquo;s growth, protection, and development as well as to increase demand for &rdquo;Pre-Primary Education for All&rdquo;.</p>
","<p>What has become clear in the course of this work is that <strong>the Sustainable Development Goal target 4.2 &ndash; all children </strong><strong>participating in organized learning (one year before the official primary entry age) &ndash; has already been largely achieved in Indonesia</strong>.&nbsp; Almost 2.5 million children below the official entry age of 7 are already enrolled in primary school &ndash; about 10% of the total SD population. There are another 2.4 million children aged 6 enrolled in a PAUD service, including <em>Raudatul athfal </em>(RA) or Islamic PAUD. What has <strong>not</strong> been achieved is the <u>larger goal of SDG 4.2</u>&ndash; all children with access to <strong>quality </strong>early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education. Thus, a large number of children living in the 16,000 or so villages with no PAUD service &ndash; if they want education at all &ndash; are compelled to enter directly from their homes into SD without the child development and school readiness benefits provided by PAUD.&nbsp; The study develops a Roadmap towards Universal Pre-primary Education of Quality by 2030.</p>","<ul><li><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Expand and Improve Taman Kanak-Kanak (TK) or kindergarten, </span><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">which are both meant to be the preferred choice of children aged 4-6 &nbsp;more closely linked to the primary school curriculum, and therefore as better preparation for primary school. Ensuring (say) 83% of children aged 5-6 enter TK rather than <em>Kelompok Bermain</em> or <em>KB</em> (from the current 78%) has implications for finance (infrastructure and salaries of more qualified and eventually more certified teachers) . This option would require new sources of funding; e.g., more from parents and/or from different levels of government and perhaps the private sector. </span></li><li>Improve the Quality of KB for Children 5-6 years old. This second option is to improve the quality of KB with the intention of not only expanding the number of children enrolled in this PAUD service (to 33% of the age group rather than the current 22%) but also making its perceived (and perhaps actual) <strong><em>quality </em></strong>equal to that of the TK &ndash; with better infrastructure, more materials and equipment, and more highly qualified and better paid teachers.&nbsp; This option is more essential, at least in the short term, for remote regions (daerah 3T) which would find it more difficult to establish a TK.</li><li>Maintain the Current Mix of KB and TK. The third option is to maintain the current mix of KB and TK more or less aligned with the existing percentages of enrolment of children aged 5-6 &ndash; 78% in TK and 22% in KB.&nbsp; This would not require any major changes in Ministry policies and instead would leave any future changes to the mix parental demand.&nbsp; In this option, both types of PAUD would be increased in number and enhanced in quality, with a special focus on the establishment of KB in villages with no PAUD service.&nbsp; The financial implications in this case would be less onerous than the first but more than the second since it would try to expand and improve both services at about the same pace. The benefit is less need for central government action in terms of new policies and priorities, and the risk is the possibility that while some local governments may champion PAUD (depending, often, on political campaign promises), other may choose to ignore it.&nbsp;</li></ul>","Studi Pengembangan & Pendidikan Usian Dini (PPAUD)","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Tujuan Pengembangan Strategi Pra-Sekolah Dasar Berkualitas untuk Semua dan Pendidikan Keluarga untuk PPAUD adalah untuk berkontribusi terhadap pencapaian tujuan penyediaan perawatan dan pendidikan anak usia dini (PPAUD) yang berkualitas secara universal di Indonesia pada tahun 2030 melalui dukungan kebijakan berbasis bukti dan pengembangan strategi perawatan dan pendidikan pra-sekolah dasar yang merata, berkelanjutan dan bermutu tinggi, termasuk pendidikan keluarga.

The program of Support for MTB-MLE for Schools in Rural and Remote Areas of Papua has the following five main objectives: (1) To design and assist with starting-up a pilot MTB-MLE Papuan Research Program; (2) To build the capacity of the newly established sub-division of Culture and Language in the Provincial Office of Education and Culture (P&amp;K Dinas Provinsi) concerning issues of MTB-MLE - mother-tongue instruction and bridging from the mother tongue to the official language (Bahasa Indonesia) in the early years of elementary schools; (3) To provide technical and capacity development support to the provincial and district offices of Education and Culture in order to integrate the language community and school mapping process and findings within the education planning system of these offices; (4) To provide technical support and capacity development to the Cendrawasih State University (UNCEN) Faculty of Education and Teaching (FKIP/LPTK) in their &quot;FKIP Revitalization&quot; program that will include the reform of the four teacher training colleges (KPGs) in Papua and West Papua provinces to incorporate Papuan MTB-MLE; (5) To provide organizational/logistical and technical support to ACDP in the dissemination of Strategic Planning Study (produced under ACDP 039) with a special focus on MTB-MLE, to district level offices of education and culture.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">The state of rural and remote education in Papua faces many challenges but the government has boldly committed itself to understanding the problems and re-visioned some of its programs to address the challenge. One of the educational options being explored is a mother tongue based multilingual education (MTB-MLE) approach for rural and remote communities whose children speak little or no Indonesian.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The study found that one of the primary differences between urban and rural children in the Lanny Jaya Kabupaten is language use. As soon as one moves outside of the urban area of Tiom, only 1% of the population use Indonesian as their language of communication and 90% use Lani language, with 3.3% mixing the two languages. From the Snapshot of School Management Effectiveness student questionnaire, the study found that Bahasa Indonesia is very much a secondary language in the baseline population of students in rural and remote area of Lanny Jaya regency, and a weak one at that. Lani/Dani is the first language of almost all of the children so most are entering school with, at best, very rudimentary proficiency. The study's survey of language use in the classroom in the most rural and remote areas, however, finds that almost 65% of the teachers surveyed choose to use a language the students find difficult and only 20% use the language the students find easy. This is linked to findings from a survey of early grade reading abilities of children in Lanny Jaya indicate that, compared to peers in Indonesia, Lani children score about 80% less than the national average. Proficiency in Bahasa Indonesia was measured by means of a listening comprehension task and three separate vocabulary assessments. The rates of progress of Lani children observed between grades 2 and 3 suggest that the rate of skill development in literacy will not reach national grade 2 norms until grade 4 or 5 (closer to 5 than 4).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">One of the primary impediment to the revitalization of the Teacher Colleges (Kolese Pendidikan Guru or KPG) in Papua to produce quality teachers able to resolve the literacy crisis issue is the need for its structural change.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">While investigating the relationship between literacy and Indonesian language ability among Lani children, the study found that there is evidence that teachers in some of the schools may be putting more instructional time in teaching Bahasa Indonesia than in teaching literacy, and that there is huge variation among the schools in terms of achievement in the remote areas.

Ã‚Â» Gender Equality Goes Beyond Access

Ã¢â‚¬ËœAchieving gender parity in access to education is only a first step. Equal access does not guarantee equality. 
Achieving gender equality in education requires that there is equal opportunity for females and males, and that 

they are treated equally and fairly. This will in turn translate to greater equality in learning achievement and 
outcomes, and beyond education, equality of opportunities in the labour market and other spheres of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.

Nina Sardjunani, Deputy Minister for Human Resources and Cultural Affairs, 
National Development Planning Agency

In the last decade, Indonesia has come a long way in improv-
ing gender equity in education access. Indonesia is on track 
to meet the Millennium Development Goals for universal 
primary education and gender parity. 

Gender parity has now been largely achieved at all levels of 
the education system, and there is parity in literacy rates for 
young people (15-24 age group).

These successes result from a combination of effective po- 
licies and sustained national investments in education that 
have expanded the availability of schools in rural areas and 
lowered the direct and opportunity costs of schooling, for 
example through gender neutral subsidy programs such as 
School Operational Funding (BOS).

However, the Government acknowledges that access alone 
does not equate to education outcomes and in recent years 
more attention has been given to quality, relevance and 
achievement.

Gender equality in education also encompasses girlsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and 
boysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ experiences in school, in terms of equal and fair treat-
ment by teachers and the gender responsiveness of the 
curriculum, textbooks and learning materials, as well as the 
learning environment and education outcomes. 

Achieving equality of opportunity in the learning process, 
learning achievement and outcomes for both boys and girls 
is a key challenge for the Government in Indonesia in the 
next decade.

Ã‚Â» Gender Responsive Teaching 
& Learning Approaches
The ways that girls and boys experience teaching and learn-
ing in the classroom can be quite different, influencing their 
class participation, educational achievement and learning 
outcomes. Social and cultural values and stereotypes about 
gender can be inadvertently reinforced in the classroom and 
at school through teacher-pupil and pupil-pupil interaction.

Teaching approaches and methods used to teach, engage 
and assess students, may also favour boys, particularly in In-
donesia where girls are often discouraged from speaking in 
public, expressing their opinions or questioning male author-
ity. 

Teachers can be key change agents for gender equality by 
encouraging boys and girls to undertake certain activities, 
providing a sense of direction and acting as role models. 

Conversely, they can reinforce disparities in achievement by 
replicating societal stereotypes in the classroom and failing 
to provide support to girls and boys where it is needed. 

Best practice in integrating gender equality into teaching and 
learning practices includes challenging stereotypes, includ-
ing attitudes towards girls and boys aptitudes, giving equal 
attention to boys and girls and encouraging girls to take part 
in extramural activities normally reserved for boys.1

There is a significant body of research that suggests that 
boys and girls learn in different ways. In particular, it has 
been found that, compared to boys, girls typically prefer to 
learn through collaboration and discussion. 

While teaching methods that promote collaborative learn-
ing tend to improve the performance of all students, they 
have a particularly strong effect on the performance of fe-
male students in subjects like mathematics.2

The district of Sleman, in Yogyakarta province, has piloted 
gender mainstreaming in schools, through the develop-
ment of a gender equality school model and training mo-
dule which was delivered to participating school principals, 
selected teachers and student counsellors.

Training included recognising and addressing gender bias 
and stereotyping in the school environment, teaching pro-
cess and learning materials. 

The trainees from pilot schools then cascaded training they 
had received to colleagues. Activities included socialising 
learning materials to students and the school community 
and producing media materials, including banners, bro-
chures and displays of each schoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision and mission. 

Stakeholders reported positive impacts, including ensur-
ing equal treatment of boys and girls, such as sharing tasks 
equally, and greater awareness of the importance of equality 
among students.

Ã‚Â» Gender Equality in Curriculum
The role of the curriculum is critical to ensuring that boys and 
girls are given equal opportunities for success and advance-
ment in schools. 

Gender bias in the curriculum and teaching and learning ma-
terials are commonplace in developing and middle-income 
countries, strengthening gender stereotypes through gen-
der-biased text and pictures.3

A gender analysis of text books in Indonesia undertaken in 
2011 found significant gender bias4 as the following exam-
ples show:

This author uses a group of three friends, two female students 
and a male student. One female is portrayed as someone who 
constantly asks questions and makes repeated mistakes like 
touching a hot pan or not turning the light off at night. 

The other female student is always asking questions, while 
the male student has the role of the competent student who 
always knows the right answers and explains them to his 
classmates.

Best practice in mainstreaming gender  equality  into  the  
curriculum and teaching materials includes regular revision 
of these materials to include gender-sensitive approaches 
and gender perspectives and the establishment of specific 
bodies that are tasked with the elimination of gender stereo-
types in textbooks and other teaching materials.5

Ã‚Â» Gender Equality in Teacher Development
Best practice in teacher development for gender equality 
means equipping teachers with an understanding of the na-
ture of gender inequality in classrooms, the wider school en-
vironment and society in general. 

It entails ensuring that teachers have the ability to promote 
this understanding in classrooms and can develop strategies 
and practical solutions to overcome the barriers to learning 
that boys and girls face.6

Training in gender equality for teachers is most effective 
when it is integrated into both the pre-service and in-service 
training programmes.

To deliver this training, teacher training institutions and net-
works need adequate capacity in teaching active learning 
pedagogy that is applied with a gender equality perspective 
in both training development and in the skills and know-
ledge of teacher trainers delivering the material. 

To date, provincial education quality assurance institutes, 
teacher training institutions, and local teacher professional 
development networks in Indonesia have not been gender 
mainstreamed.

However, there are examples of emerging good practice. In 
2008, selected schools in Kupang district participated in a 
gender equality pilot project7 to train principals and teach-
ers in the concept of gender equality in education and to 
apply gender-responsive teaching and learning in schools.

A key element of the pilot project was the development of 
a Gender Mainstreaming in Schools training module by par-
ticipating primary, junior secondary and senior secondary 
teachers, principals, tutors, academics and members of the 
provincial Gender Working Group. 

This resulted in revisions to schoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision and mission, 
teaching and learning materials and learning approaches to 
be gender responsive.

Many good practice models exist internationally. In response 
to a pervasive lack of gender sensitive teaching approaches 
across Africa, the Forum for African Women Educationalists 
(FAWE) developed the Gender Responsive Pedagogy (GRP) 
model in 2005, subsequently introduced in 13 countries.8 

The model trains teachers to be gender aware, equipping 
them with the skills to understand the specific learning 
needs of both sexes. 

It develops teaching practices that engender equal treat-
ment and participation of boys and girls, and trains teachers 
in the design and use of gender-responsive teaching and 
learning materials, lesson plans, language in the classroom, 
classroom interaction, and strategies to eliminate sexual ha-
rassment. Implementation of the GRP model has led to im-
provement in girlsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ retention and performance and greater 
participation by girls in classroom activities.

Ã‚Â» Gender Equality in Learning Achievement
Gender disparities in educational achievement are  not  in-
evitable. There is no inherent difference in the capabilities of 
girls and boys in mathematics, science and reading. 

Under the right conditions boys and girls can perform equal-
ly well in these subjects.

However, results from all four Indonesia PISA assessments 
carried out over the last decade with 15 year old students 
show that malesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ achievement lags behind that of females in 
literacy skills (relevant to Bahasa Indonesia and English sub-
jects) - a trend that is occurring globally in literacy. 

A 2011 study9 assessment results also show that while female 
students had significantly higher achievements than male 
students in Bahasa Indonesian and English, male students 
outperformed female students in science. 

There was no significant gender difference in achievements 
in mathematics.

Male and female studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and teachersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perceptions during 
informal interviews in junior and senior secondary schools 
for the ACDP study unanimously reflected the idea that boys 
were better at science and girls were better at Bahasa Indo-
nesia and English.

Furthermore, stakeholders reported that neither principals 
nor teachers knew how to develop strategies to encourage 
males and females who underperformed in different sub-
jects, to close gender gaps in learning achievement.

In choosing subject specialisms at senior secondary level 
and beyond, careers counselors do not encourage females 
to choose subjects and follow career paths which are tradi-
tionally perceived as occupying the male domain. 

Because of the perceptions of counselors and gender stereo-
types about femalesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and malesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ aptitude for mathematics 
and science at the primary and secondary school level, fewer 
females enrol in science and technology related courses in 
secondary vocational and higher education as compared to 
males. While gender stereotypes encourage females to pur-
sue careers in administration, child development, education 
and public health, males tend to dominate in the sciences, 
engineering, technology and law.

Ã‚Â» Conclusion
Much good practice and innovation in mainstreaming gen-
der equality in education exists Ã¢â‚¬â€œ both in Indonesia, and in-
ternationally. 

However, in Indonesia, opportunities are missed because 
such practice remains largely localized and relatively small 
scale, often through limited pilot projects which seldom 
move to scale.

A key challenge is therefore to evaluate and disseminate 
good practice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and to prioritise resources and budgets to 
scale up initiatives that will make a difference.

The ACDP study found that whilst there is general support for 
gender issues at central level, there is currently a lack of clear 
strategic direction for gender mainstreaming in education, 
and limited specialist technical capacity. 

Renewed efforts are required to mainstream gender aware-
ness in key education policy and planning institutions - and 
momentum must be maintained by constantly regenerating 
skills and knowledge.

Equality of external results is achieved when the status of 
men and women; their access to goods and resources; and 
their ability to contribute to, participate in, and benefit from 
economic, social, cultural, and political activities are equal. 

This implies that career opportunities and the earnings of 
men and women with similar qualifications and experience 
are equal. 

Although this dimension of equality falls outside the educa-
tion system, the achievement of equality in education acts 
as a catalyst and contributes to the realisation of equality for 
males and females in other spheres of life, including the la-
bour market and the domestic sphere.

Ã‚Â» Tingkat Ketidakhadiran Guru di Indonesia
Secara umum, sekitar satu dari sepuluh guru tidak hadir di 
sekolah ketika dijadwalkan mengajar. Pada kunjungan per-
tama, 10% guru tidak hadir, sementara pada kunjungan 
kedua, 11% guru tidak hadir. Di SD-SD sampel pada studi ta-
hun 2003 yang dikunjungi kembali pada studi kali ini, tingkat 
ketidakhadiran guru turun dari 19% pada 2003 menjadi 10% 
pada 2013.

Temuan ini tentu membesarkan harapan bagi bangsa Indo-
nesia.  Dari  sini   tampak   ada   penurunan   tingkat   ketidak-
hadiran guru dalam jumlah yang besar sejak sepuluh tahun 
lalu. Selain itu, estimasi ketidakhadiran guru di sekolah-seko-
lah di Indonesia pada 2013 umumnya lebih rendah daripada 
di berbagai negara berkembang lainnya.Meskipun demikian, 
temuan tersebut hendaknya tidak membuat bangsa ini lekas 
berpuas diri. Tingkat ketidakhadiran guru di sekolah sebesar 
10% masih tinggi. 

Di banyak sekolah, meski guru berada di sekolah, tingkat 
ketidakhadiran guru di kelas bahkan menunjukkan angka 
yang lebih tinggi. 

royek ini merupakan salah satu studi ketidakhadiran guru paling menyeluruh dan berskala besar yang pernah dilaku-
kan di manapun di dunia. Dalam studi ini, dua tim yang telah menerima pelatihan khusus melakukan dua kunjungan tampa 
pemberitahuan sebelumnya ke sekolah saat kegiatan belajar mengajar sedang berlangsung. 

Kedua tim mengumpulkan data tentang ketidakhadiran guru, mengamati kegiatan kelas, melakukan wawancara dengan kepa-
la sekolah dan guru, dan memberi tes singkat kepada beberapa murid sampel. Kunjungan pertama dilakukan pada akhir 2013, 
sementara kunjungan kedua pada awal 2014. 

Wawancara juga dilakukan dengan pejabat di tingkat kabupaten. Studi ini tidak hanya meneliti  ketidakhadiran  guru di  seko-
lah,  tetapi j uga  ketidakhadiran  guru  di  kelas  saat  jam  mengajar, 

sekalipun saat itu mereka sedang berada di lingkungan sekolah.

Sampel akhir terdiri atas 880 sekolah dasar (SD) dan sekolah menengah pertama (SMP) yang tersebar di enam wilayah, yaitu 
Sumatra, Jawa, Bali dan Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi, Kalimantan, serta Papua dan Maluku. 

Sampel tersebut mencakup 119 dari 147 SD pada studi yang sama pada 2003. Secara keseluruhan, data dikumpulkan dari 
8.300 guru dan 8.200 murid lebih. Kerja sama semua pihak yang berkontribusi pada studi ini sangat dihargai.

Di antara guru-guru yang dijadwalkan mengajar, 14% 
ditemukan ada di sekolah tetapi tidak berada di kelas ketika 
kunjungan pertama dan 12% saat kunjungan kedua. 

Studi menemukan  bahwa  tingkat  ketidakhadiran  guru  
sangatlah bervariasi antar jenis guru, wilayah, dan jenis seko-
lah. Adanya perbedaan tingkat kehadiran guru antar sekolah 
dengan karakteristik yang berbeda menunjukkan bahwa ke-
bijakan-kebijakan yang bertujuan mengubah keadaan seko-
lah efektif dalam mengurangi tingkat ketidakhadiran guru.

Tingkat ketidakhadiran guru secara umum lebih tinggi pada:

 Ã‚Â» kalangan guru laki-laki daripada guru perempuan,
 Ã‚Â» kalangan guru yang mengajar di lebih dari satu sekolah,
 Ã‚Â» sekolah-sekolah terpencil daripada di sekolah-sekolah perko-

taan,

 Ã‚Â» sekolah-sekolah dengan sarana fisik yang kurang memandai,
 Ã‚Â» sekolah-sekolah yang belum mencapai Standar Pelayanan Min-

imum (SPM) hasil analisis studi ini

 Ã‚Â» sekolah-sekolah yang kepala sekolahnya tidak hadir di sekolah 
atau tidak memberikan teladan kehadiran yang baik kepada 
para guru,

 Ã‚Â» sekolah-sekolah yang akhir-akhir ini belum dikunjungi oleh di-
nas pendidikan kabupaten, dan

 Ã‚Â» ekolah-sekolah yang komite sekolahnya kurang berperan 
dalam pemantauan anggaran sekolah atau kurang menjalin 

hubungan orang tua murid dengan sekolah.

Ã‚Â» Alasan Guru Tidak Hadir di Sekolah
Secara  nasional,  alasan  yang paling  umum ketidak-hadiran 
guru adalah melaksanakan tugas resmi yang masih berkaitan 
dengan kegiatan mengajar (26%), terutama menghadiri ra-
pat dan seminar. 

Terdapat perbedaan signifikan antar wilayah terkait tugas 
resmi ini, dengan 35% ketidakhadiran guru di Jawa karena 
alasan ini dan hanya 9% untuk di Papua dan Maluku. Semen-
tara itu, di Sumatra dan Kalimantan, alasan yang paling sering 
dikemukakan adalah akibat terlambat datang; sekitar satu 
dari empat guru absen karena terlambat. 

Kemudian, di Sulawesi, Bali, dan Nusa Tenggara, satu dari em-
pat guru absen tanpa memberikan alasan yang jelas kepada 
kepala sekolah atau staf sekolah yang diwawancarai.

Ã‚Â» Kegiatan Guru di Sekolah Ketika Sedang Tidak 
Mengajar
Guru-guru   yang   sedang  berada  di   sekolah    tetapi   tidak  
mengajarÃ¢â‚¬â€terlepas   mereka      dijadwalkan  mengajar   atau 
tidakÃ¢â‚¬â€sangat sering ditemukan mengerjakan kegiatan yang 
tidak masuk dalam kategori kegiatan akademis ataupun 
administratif. 

Penjelasan yang paling sering diberikan adalah Ã¢â‚¬ËœmenungguÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, 
yaitu menunggu kelas berikutnya dalam jadwal mengajar 
hari itu atau menunggu bel pulang berbunyi jika mereka su-
dah selesai mengajar pada hari itu. Mereka terkadang berbin-
cang-bincang dengan rekan guru lain di ruang guru, memba-
ca buku, menyiapkan makanan, atau makan. 

Jenis kegiatan paling sering kedua adalah pekerjaan admin-
istratif, termasuk membantu di kantor kepala sekolah atau 
urusan administrasi, menjaga kamar unit kesehatan sekolah 
(UKS), memasukkan data ke dalam basis data, dan mengam-
bil alih kelas yang tidak ada gurunya. 

Satu dari empat guru yang tidak hadir di kelas ditemukan 
melakukan kegiatan akademis lain seperti menyiapkan bahan 
ajar atau memeriksa pekerjaan murid.

Ã‚Â» Dampak Ketidakhadiran Guru
Tingginya tingkat ketidakhadiran guru berpengaruh sangat 
buruk terhadap kegiatan operasional sekolah, guru-guru lain, 
dan para murid. Di antara temuan utama studi ini adalah:

 Ã‚Â» Dari semua kelas yang sedang berlangsung ketika kunjun-
gan tampa pemberitahuan dilakukan, 9% tidak ada gurunya 
sepanjang jam pelajaran dan 5% lainnya tidak ada gurunya 
untuk beberapa waktu hingga guru kelas tersebut kembali ke 
kelas.

 Ã‚Â» Jika kelas-kelas yang tidak ada gurunya turut dipertimbang-
kan, di SD-SD diperkirakan hanya berlangsung rata-rata 19 jam 
pengajaran per minggu, sementara di SMP-SMP hanya 23 jam. 
Angka-angka tersebut jauh berada di bawah persyaratan Stan-
dar Pelayanan Minimal Pendidikan Dasar.

 Ã‚Â» Sekitar dua pertiga kelas yang tidak ada gurunya terdapat guru 
pengganti. Sebagian besar dari guru pengganti tersebut ditu-
gaskan mengisi lebih dari satu kelas pada jam pelajaran yang 
sama.

 Ã‚Â» Di SMP-SMP yang dikunjungi, hanya sekitar 40% guru peng-
ganti adalah guru mata pelajaran yang sama.

 Ã‚Â» Di kelas-kelas yang tidak ada gurunya, besar kemungkinan mu-
rid-murid tidak diberi tugas khusus.

 Ã‚Â» Tingkat ketidakhadiran murid di kelas lebih tinggi di seko-
lah-sekolah yang tingkat ketidakhadiran gurunya tinggi.

 Ã‚Â» Ditemukan sejumlah bukti bahwa tingkat ketidakhadiran guru 
yang tinggi di SD-SD sampel berkaitan dengan capaian murid 
yang rendah pada mata pelajaran matematika.

Prestasi belajar murid mencerminkan sejumlah faktor terkait 
latar belakang rumah tangga dan situasi sekolah. Oleh kare-
nanya, mengidentifikasi dampak ketidakhadiran guru pada 
murid dalam konteks praktik belajar dan mengajar di seko-
lah adalah masalah yang kompleks. 

Studi-studi di masa datang akan dapat mengambil manfaat 
dari metode penelitian longitudinal dalam meneliti hubu- 
ngan-hubungan yang penting di atas, khususnya melalui 
pengukuran cakupan serta dampak dari ketidakhadiran 
guru yang berlangsung dalam jangka panjang atau secara 
berulang pada pembelajaran dan motivasi murid.

Ã‚Â» Implikasi Kebijakan
Kemajuan Indonesia dalam mengurangi tingkat ketidakhad-
iran guru dalam sepuluh tahun terakhir perlu dipertahankan    
demi    meningkatkan   capaian   murid  dan 
mengurangi disparitas antar sekolah.

Mengatasi masalah ketidakhadiran guru menuntut lang-
kah-langkah yang terkoordinasi   dalam   menghadapi tanta-
ngan di berbagai tingkat dalam sistem pendidikan Indonesia

Di tingkat nasional, prioritas diberikan pada hal-hal berikut:

 Ã‚Â» Menimbang ulang kebijakan nasional yang ada tentang jam 
kerja guru dengan tujuan mengecilkan peluang bagi guru un-
tuk mengajar di lebih dari satu sekolah.

 Ã‚Â» Memperluas cakupan standar yang ada terkait hal-hal yang di-
harapkan dari guru sehingga mencakup waktu dan tanggung 
jawab mereka di luar tugas mengajar. Peran guru di luar kegia-
tan mengajar di kelas perlu diperjelas. Selain itu, lingkungan 
sekolah perlu menciptakan situasi yang mendorong dan men-
dukung guru agar mereka menggunakan waktu di luar kelas 
untuk kemanfaatan murid.

 Ã‚Â» Melanjutkan upaya-upaya yang lebih luas menyangkut pendis-
tribusian  guru   dalam   sistem   pendidikan   Indonesia.   Ke- 
tidakhadiran guru di sekolah ternyata terjadi bukan karena  
faktor kekurangan guru. Akan tetapi, sebagaimana disimpul-
kan oleh studi ini dan beberapa studi lain, hal ini adalah bagian 
dari  tantangan yang lebih luas, yaitu distribusi guru yang tidak 

merata dalam sistem pendidikan Indonesia.

Di tingkat kabupaten, prioritas diberikan pada hal-hal berikut:

 Ã‚Â» Memperkuat dukungan bagi dan pengawasan atas proses be-
lajar dan mengajar. Kunjungan reguler dan terfokus oleh peja-
bat pemerintahan di tingkat kabupaten dapat membantu me-
nekankan pentingnya kerja guru dan mengisyaratkan bahwa 
kabupaten efisien dalam bekerja dengan berjalannya sejumlah 
kegiatan yang secara langsung maupun tidak langsung men-
dorong kehadiran guru di kelas.

 Ã‚Â» Makin memusatkan upaya mendukung sekolah dalam mer-
ekam dan menelusuri tingkat  ketidakhadiran guru.  Mesin  
absensi sidik jari bisa dipertimbangkan untuk tujuan ini, tetapi 
tanpa perubahan yang lebih luas hingga ke tingkat   kabupa- 
ten, penggunaan   mesin   tersebut kecil kemungkinan akan 

mendatangkan hasil yang diharapkan.

Tingkat ketidakhadiran guru yang bervariasi lebih cenderung 
disebabkan oleh perbedaan antar sekolah daripada perbe-
daan antar provinsi atau kabupaten. Oleh karenanya, ada se-
jumlah faktor yang berimplikasi pada sekolah. 

Implikasi-implikasi tersebut membutuhkan sejumlah lang-
kah yang bersifat melengkapi di tingkat nasional, provinsi, 
dan kabupaten, di antaranya:

 Ã‚Â» Penguatan prosedur seleksi dan pengembangan kompetensi 
kepala sekolah sebagai langkah penting untuk mengembang-
kan Ã¢â‚¬Å“budaya hadir di sekolah dan berperan sertaÃ¢â‚¬Â di antara para 
guru.

 Ã‚Â» Menyediakan dukungan dan kebijakan yang jelas bagi sekolah 
dalam menangani ketidakhadiran guru dan mengelola guru 
pengganti sedemikian rupa sehingga dampaknya minimal 
bagi murid.

 Ã‚Â» Menyediakan dukungan yang lebih besar bagi sekolah dalam 
meningkatkan pengelolaan jadwal sekolah dan peran guru 
demi pemanfaatan waktu guru secara maksimal.

 Ã‚Â» Membangun keterlibatan masyarakat setempat yang lebih 
konstruktif dalam urusan sekolah.

 Ã‚Â» Mengadakan pertemuan dan pelatihan di luar jam mengajar, 
bilamana memungkinkan.

Adalah penting untuk mempertimbangkan secara hati-hati 
manfaat dan biaya relatif berbagai pilihan kebijakan. 

Sebagai contoh, walaupun menaikkan gaji guru dapat me- 
ngurangi keterpaksaan untuk mempunyai lebih dari satu 
pekerjaan, ini mungkin bukan strategi yang sama hematn-
ya dalam hal pembiayaan dibandingkan dengan, misalnya, 
penguatan prosedur seleksi dan pengembangan kompe-
tensi kepala sekolah.

Di negara sebesar dan seberagam Indonesia, banyak yang 
bisa dipetik dari studi-studi percontohan yang dirancang 
dengan saksama sebelum studi-studi tersebut diimplemen-
tasikan secara luas. 

Selain itu, ada banyak manfaat yang dapat diperoleh dengan 
memastikan bahwa kepala sekolah dan guru mendukung 
arah kebijakan yang sedang dilaksanakan. Bagaimana pun, 
mereka adalah aktor-aktor utama yang harus memastikan 
bahwa kebijakan terlaksana secara efektif. Kepala sekolah 
dan guru, bersama dengan para murid, adalah pihak-pihak 
yang paling diuntungkan apabila tingkat ketidakhadiran 
guru dapat ditekan serendah mungkin.

Risalah kebijakan ini disusun berdasarkan sebuah studi yang 
dilakukan pada 2013 dan 2014 atas dukungan dana dari ACDP, yai-
tu Studi tentang Ketidakhadiran Guru (ACDPÃ¢â‚¬â€011). Studi tersebut 
dilakukan oleh Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) 
dan Lembaga Penelitian SMERU atas nama Cambridge Education.

In 2016, 110 SGDs were planned to be built in 43 selected districts in Indonesia through the revitalization of existing schools and the construction of new school units. The SGD development will incorporate curriculum and pedagogy approaches that are appropriate to the often unique characteristics of the local context. Rather than being ideal or &quot;model&quot; schools in terms of resource provision, the SGDs will learn from international and national experiences to be exemplars of innovative processes involving the engagement of local communities, school planning, architecture, curriculum, pedagogy, teacher recruitment and professional development. It is hoped that SGDs will introduce quality and relevant education to impact local as well as national development. ACDP facilitated a high level workshop in June 2016 to map out key principles that would guide the development of the SGDs, as well as coordinate activities from the different related operation units in MoEC. The workshop invited selected practitioners representing good practice, namely Sokola Rimba, Sekolah Kampung (to discuss the challenges and successes in addressing education in rural and remote areas), Indonesia Mengajar (innovative teacher development and pedagogy) and Sekolah Masjid Terminal (schools for marginalized populations in urban areas/slums). A team of researchers and anthropologists working internationally as well as in eastern Indonesia, Reality Check Approach, also shared their unique approach to qualitative research in the sort of locations selected for SGDs. Promising practices and lessons from other countries were also identified and presented in a keynote presentation by David Harding of ACDP. The approach, it was argued, must match resources to the local context in innovative ways, such as geography, culture, language and community demand, while striving to reach the highest standards of education in a phased process over time. ACDP assisted with further development of Frontline Schools prior to MoEC launching the program in October 2016.</p>

SGD adalah salah satu program prioritas Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan yang bertujuan tidak hanya untuk meningkatkan mutu pendidikan di daerah terpencil, tertinggal, terluar dan marjinal di Indonesia, tetapi juga untuk menggeser status sekolah tersebut dari yang diabaikan dan ditinggalkan menjadi sekolah contoh. Pada tahun 2016, 110 SGD direncanakan akan dibangun di 43 kabupaten terpilih di Indonesia melalui revitalisasi sekolah yang ada dan pembangunan unit sekolah baru. Pengembangan SGD menggabungkan pendekatan kurikulum dan pedagogi yang sesuai dengan karakteristik khas dari konteks lokal. Alih-alih menjadi sekolah ideal atau â€œModelâ€ dalam hal penyediaan sumber daya, SGD akan belajar dari pengalaman internasional dan nasional untuk menjadi sekolah percontohan dalam proses inovatif yang melibatkan keterlibatan masyarakat lokal, perencanaan sekolah, arsitektur, kurikulum, pedagogi, rekrutmen guru dan pengembangan profesional. Diharapkan SGD akan memperkenalkan kualitas dan pendidikan yang relevan untuk pembangunan daerah maupun nasional. ACDP memfasilitasi lokakarya tingkat tinggi pada bulan Juni 2016 untuk memetakan prinsip utama yang akan memandu perkembangan SGD, serta mengkoordinasikan kegiatan dari unit operasi terkait yang berbeda di Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan. Lokakarya mengundang praktisi tertentu yang mewakili praktek yang baik, yaitu Sokola Rimba, Sekolah Kampung (untuk membahas permasalahan dan keberhasilan dalam mengatasi pendidikan di daerah pedesaan dan terpencil), Indonesia Mengajar (pengembangan guru dan pedagogi yang inovatif) dan Sekolah Masjid Terminal (sekolah bagi penduduk yang terpinggirkan di daerah perkotaan/kumuh). Sebuah tim peneliti dan antropolog yang bekerja secara internasional serta di bagian timur Indonesia, Reality Check Approach, juga berbagi pendekatan unik untuk penelitian kualitatif dalam jenis lokasi yang dipilih untuk SGD. Praktek yang menjanjikan dan pelajaran dari negara lain juga diidentifikasi dan disajikan dalam presentasi utama oleh David Harding dari ACDP. Pendekatan, sebagaimana dibicarakan, harus disesuaikan dengan sumber daya lokal seperti geografi, budaya, bahasa dan permintaan masyarakat dengan cara yang inovatif, dan juga diupayakan untuk mencapai standar tertinggi pendidikan secara bertahap dari waktu ke waktu. ACDP dibantu dengan pengembangan lebih lanjut dari Sekolah Garis Depan sebelum Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan meluncurkan program pada Oktober 2016.</p>","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/policybrief-fgd-en-pt.jpg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/policybrief-fgd-en-lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","Ringkasan Kebijakan; Pedesaan; Daerah Terpencil; Pembangunan Pedesaan; Pendidikan Pedesaan; Sekolah Pedesaan; Kurikulum; Konteks Budaya","Working with the Center for Policy Analysis and Synchronization (PASKA), ACDP is providing support to the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) in ","Bekerja dengan Pusat Analisis dan Sinkronisasi Kebijakan (PASKA), ACDP memberikan bantuan kepada Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan (Kemendikbud) d","","","8/1/2016 00:00:00","125","1","0","1","1","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:15","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

The policy brief lays out major issues surrounding SMKs in Aceh. One of the main foci in this study is on the vocational teachers. This study found that teacher quality issues were at least and probably more pressing than shortages among vocational teachers. A second major issue is located in the mismatch of curriculum and study program to skill demand. While the economic potential of districts surveyed was mostly reflected in the content of secondary vocational programs, the current set of courses are not always considered by school principals as meeting the needs of the community. This was especially true in the primary sector, in both agriculture (including fisheries and plantations) and mining, as well as in tourism. Thus there was often a mismatch between study programs and jobs taken upon graduation. Lastly, major study finding include another instance reflecting the lack of a dynamic interactions between SMK and local or regional businesses.

CONTEXT

The Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) 

recognises the importance of exemplary principals 

in high-performing school systems. School principals 

are therefore required to demonstrate the five 

competency standards defined in the Ministry of 

National Education (MoNE)1 Regulation 13, 2007. This 

Regulation specifies broad groupings of competencies 

that principals are expected to demonstrate. These 

competencies are categorised as Ã¢â‚¬ËœpersonalityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, 

Ã¢â‚¬ËœmanagerialÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœentrepreneurshipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœsupervisionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and 

Ã¢â‚¬ËœsocialÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ competence. 

In addition to Regulation 13, 2007, the Ministerial 

Regulation 28/2010 establishes the legal basis for 

principal preparation, principal licensing, recruitment 

and appointment, and performance appraisal. Through 

the implementation of policies on certification, licensure 

and program accreditation, these official strategies are 

intended to enable the Indonesian Government and 

districts, to control the recruitment of school principals. 

Regulation 28/2010 states that applicants must be a 

III/c ranked civil servant who has at least five years of 

teaching experience; a BachelorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree or Diploma 

IV from an accredited university; are no older than 54 

years of age; and are certified educators. 

One of the key components of Regulation 28/2010 is the 

Principal Preparation Program (PPP). This professional 

learning program is offered nationally, by the Institute 

for the Development and Empowerment of School 

Principals (LPPKS).2 The PPP prepares and certifies 

teachers to become principals based upon the required 

competencies principals are expected to demonstrate. 

Teachers participating in the PPP must successfully 

complete three stages of professional learning: 70 

hours of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœin-service learningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which is conducted face-

1  The Ministry of National Education (MoNE) has been renamed as the 

Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC). 

2 LPPKS is Lembaga Pengembangan dan Pemberdayaan Kepala Sekolah

to-face; 200 hours of on-the-jobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ learning which occurs 

over 3 months and requires participants to undertake a 

school-based research project; and another 30 hours of 

Ã¢â‚¬Ëœin-serviceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ face-to-face learning and assessment. Those 

teachers who successfully complete the professional 

learning are awarded a NUKS.3 Once teachers have 

a NUKS they are then eligible to be considered for a 

principal position in their districts.

The effective preparation of school principals is 

dependent upon high quality professional learning 

prior to becoming a principal, as well as ongoing 

professional learning while being a school principal. 

Professional learning programs such as the PPP are 

informed by compelling research suggesting that the 

professional development of aspiring principals will lead 

to improvements in the quality of schools, and thereby 

to improved learning outcomes for students. This Policy 

Brief outlines the characteristics that effective school 

principals demonstrate, that inform the development 

of effective principal preparation programs. The role of 

LPPKS is then described in the context of approaches 

to professional learning that lead to all school principals 

having a NUKS by 2030.

EFFECTIVE SCHOOL PRINCIPALS

Principal effectiveness is recognised as fundamental to 
achieving high-performing schools. Principals are held 
accountable for the delivery of specified learning outcomes  
for students, and as such, principals are more than simply 
supervisors of teachers and students. Principals are required 
to provide educational leadership in their schools; provide 
effective professional development for their teachers; 
establish priorities for the use of their schoolsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ finances; work 
in collaboration with their teachers and school communities 
to ensure the curriculum and pedagogies are appropriate for 
their students; and engage in regular evaluation and school 
improvement processes.

Principals who provide effective school leadership are 
visionary and can communicate their vision of a high 
performing school to their communities and external policy-
makers. They build relationships based upon honesty and 
respect for every individual within the community, and they 
adapt their style of leadership according to the circumstances 
at hand. Effective school principals create a strong culture for 
learning and achievement, and support teachers to perform 
well. They focus professional learning approaches toward 
school improvement, and ensure that data management 
systems are in place, and are used to inform those school 
improvement strategies. Effective school principals create 
the conditions for the conduct of School and Classroom 
Action Research (CAR) that is used to inform practice, and 
they analyse student performance data, and take actions 
based upon their findings. Together these strategies are seen 
to make a difference to the quality of studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ experiences 
at school.

One of the characteristics of high performing schools is 
that school variables such as the quality of teachers; the 
quality of leadership, management and administration; the 
school facilities including technologies; and the curriculum, 
assessment and reporting processes, are all aligned. When 
these variables are addressed separately however, schools 
show only incremental impacts on learning. It is when these 
individual variables combine that important differences are 
made to the quality of school education and to studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 
learning. Establishing the conditions under which these 
respective variables successfully combine, is one of the roles 
of school principals. Therefore principals are central to the 
quality of education provided in the schools they lead. 

Research strongly suggests that a school leader who makes a 
difference to studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ learning demonstrates the following 
characteristics:

he/she has a moral purpose;

he/she understands change;

he/she improves relationships within and beyond the 
school;

he/she fosters knowledge creation and the sharing of 
knowledge within their schools;

he/she is an expert in drawing together and making 
coherent the various policies to be implemented within 
their schools;

he/she cultivates leaders at multiple levels within the 
school including among the teachers and students; and 

he/she enhances the teaching profession through 
providing leadership.

In order to develop exemplary school principals an effective 
programme is required to train appropriately selected 
teachers to become school leaders. 

EFFECTIVE PRINCIPAL PREPARATION

Evaluations of principal preparation programs show the 
importance of addressing the curriculum or pedagogical 
leadership role of school principals, as well as the 
administration or management roles of principals. Principal 
preparation programs also have to support aspiring 
principals to develop their leadership skills so that their 
future school communities recognise them as educational 
leaders. 

The design of principal preparation programs has to meet the 
specific requirements of the education system. In addition, 
principal preparation programs have to provide transitional 
support for those moving into the role of a principal. 
Strategies such as mentoring and coaching programs ensure 
that newly accredited principals succeed and stay on the job.

Indicators of successful principal preparation programs 
include the following: 

1. Purpose: The purpose of the professional learning 
program is explicit, and focuses on the education of 
teachers aspiring to be school leaders. The goals of the 
program reflect the demands made of future school 
leaders, schools, and children; and the definition 
of success is tied to student learning in the schools 
administered by the graduates of the professional 
learning program. The purpose of the program is 
supported by policies and administrative guidelines.

2. Coherence: The content of the professional learning 
program is documented and matches its purposes and 
goals. The coherence of the program is obvious to the 
participants in the program. The content is rigorous, 
logical, coherent, and organised to teach the skills and 
knowledge required by principals at specific types of 
schools. 

3. Balance: The content of the professional learning 
program integrates the theory and practice of leadership 
and administration with the realities of the daily work of 
principals in schools.

4. Composition of staff providing the professional 
learning: The facilitators employed in the professional 
learning programs include academics and practitioners. 
The facilitators are expert in school leadership, up-to-
date in their field, and are intellectually productive (ie 
they produce and publish their own research). Taken as 
a whole, the composition of the staff covers the fields 
of expertise required to be aligned with the content 
to be taught, the assessments to be made, and the 
characteristics of the participants who are enrolled.

5. Admissions: The admission criteria used to select 
participants into the professional learning program are 
designed to recruit aspiring principals who have the 
capacity and motivation to become successful school 
principals. 

6. Research and development: Approaches to school-
based research and professional learning are carried 
out in the program so that aspiring school principals 
can learn how to lead research and staff development 
that can be used to inform future practice within their 
schools.

7. Finances: The financial resources allocated to the 
delivery of the professional learning include the purchase 
of additional teachers to replace the participants from 
their daily work, to allow them to participate in the 
program without leaving their classes without teachers.

8. Assessment: The professional learning program 
engages the participants in continuing assessment, 
including self-assessment and improvement in both 
the off-the-job and on-the-job professional learning 
components.

9. Evaluation: the principal preparation program itself is 
subject to regular review and evaluation that is based 
on feedback from participants, facilitators, and policy 
makers. The evaluations are carried out to ensure the 
program is of high quality; the content is accurate and 
contemporary; driven by practice; is offered in cost 
effective ways; and is useful to both practitioners and 
policy makers.

INSTITUTE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND 
EMPOWERMENT OF SCHOOL PRINCIPALS 

The responsibility for the delivery of principal preparation 
programs in Indonesia rests with the Institute for the 
Development and Empowerment of School Principals 
(LPPKS). 

LPPKS was created through Permendiknas No. 6/2009 (On the 
Organization and Work: LPPKS). Permendiknas No. 39/2012 
revised and updated the work of LPPKS, as did Permendiknas 
No 45/2013. These respective regulations and amendments 
outline the main tasks LPPKS is to perform. These tasks 
include the oversight for the preparation, development and 
empowerment of principals, as the following selection from 
the 2012 amendments, illustrates.

ACDP INDONESIA Education Sector Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership

The role of LPPKS is to:

prepare the plans, programs and budgets for LPPKS;

prepare programs that focus on the empowerment 
perspective for aspiring principals;

implement programs to specifically increase the 
competencies of aspiring principals in regards to data and 
data management;

implement document storage and maintenance at LPPKS; 
and

lead the ongoing development of LPPKS.

The vision for LPPKS is 

Ã¢â‚¬Å“to be the best institution to develop trustworthy 
principals, who are entrepreneurial and professionalÃ¢â‚¬Â. 

The mission for LPPKS includes the following:

Instill honesty, integrity and commitment in education;

Instill an entrepreneurial spirit (e.g. being innovative, 
creative, confident, competitive, hard working, risk-taking, 
good at capturing opportunities) through various training 
and debriefing activities relevant to being a school principal;

Develop principal capabilities consistent with international 
best practice;

Develop managerial skills, leadership skills, and 
technological skills in principals; and

Integrate the concept of spiritual leadership with modern 
management approaches, as a foundation for values and 
work culture of the principal in leading a school.

To achieve these outcomes, LPPKS is expected to work 
collaboratively with district dinas pendidikan, Badan 
Kepegawaian Daerah (BKD) (Regional Employment Board) 
and with the central Ministries for Education and Culture and 
Religious Affairs (MoEC and MoRA). 

PRINCIPAL PREPARATION IN 2016 AND FUTURE 
PROJECTIONS

There are about 217,000 principals in Indonesia of which 
only 5,000 principals already have a NUKS. In addition, there 
are about 9,000 aspiring principals who already have a NUKS. 
To ensure that all principals in Indonesia have a NUKS by 
2030 would require the LPPKS to operate as the national, 
apex school leadership development agency in Indonesia. 
Further, if all principals in Indonesia are to have a NUKS by 
2030, it would require about 14,000 aspiring principals to 
successfully complete the PPP and receive a NUKS each year 
from 2016 to 2030. If the PPP were conducted twice a year, 
every year until 2030, this would require the training of an 
additional 117 Master Trainers per year, and an additional 
660 Assessors to be trained each year.

To achieve this outcome would also require the accreditation 
of institutions in districts to train aspiring principals; and the 
conduct of merit selection processes for participants into 
PPP to be undertaken in the districts.

LPPKS would therefore have responsibility for:

training the Master Trainers and Assessors located in 
districts; 

accrediting Master Trainers and training organisations in 
districts to offer PPP (e.g. universities; LPMP);

monitoring the quality and consistency of the 
professional learning provided in districts;

regularly reviewing and updating the professional 
learning materials;

certifying successful graduates of PPP with a NUKS;

continuing to maintain a database of aspiring principals 
and principals with a NUKS;

extending the role of LPPKS to work with Dinas Pendidikan 
and BKD to monitor the placement of graduates of PPP; 

training the supervisors to support the implementation 
of PPP and to support those who are both successful and 
unsuccessful in districts;

regularly reviewing the business model underpinning the 
delivery of PPP to accommodate the required practices; 

developing strategic relationships with MoRA; and

offering PPP to the private school sector.

One of primary roles of LPPKS would be to train the Master 
Trainers located in the districts. The provision of professional 
learning would have to be aimed at developing the 
capabilities of aspiring principals within their local contexts 
to:

support the active learning of students in classrooms;

lead school improvement strategies;

lead the in-school professional development of teachers;

conduct coaching and mentoring conversations with 
teachers;

conduct appraisals of teachersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ competencies; 

increase parent participation in school-based decision-
making; 

assume accountability to their school communities; and

increase the amount of active, problem-solving 
undertaken by students in classrooms. 

All Master Trainers would be required to have strong 
digital technology skills, and be able to demonstrate an 
understanding of how digital technologies can be used in 
classrooms to support learning.

Such large scale professional learning would require the 
LPPKS website be a national focus for the provision of 
current information and resources to support participants 
and graduates of PPP. To support this policy option would 
require that the following steps are taken:

the LPPKS website is upgraded to provide current 
information during the socialisation processes, that is 
coordinated with district processes;

all resources and materials used in PPP be placed on a 
password protected part of the LPPKS website which is 
regularly maintained and updated;

the LPPKS website includes a repository of resources 
that support PPP, and includes current, suitable journal 
articles and other relevant resources; and

some of the professional learning modules are 
transferred to an online learning environment so that the 
participants have to develop their ICT skills, and can learn 
some of the content at the same time.

In addition, the online IT infrastructure at LPPKS would need 
to be improved so that data about graduates from PPP is 
linked with information about the graduatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ NUKS; and the 
contact details of graduates of PPP are maintained securely 
online, and updated regularly. This will require that the NUKS 
data are reviewed and checked for accuracy on a regular 
basis. 

To ensure the protocols for data management and the 
interoperability of data are aligned and agreed, a national 
data interoperability working party would need to be 
established. 

These respective approaches to principal preparation 
in Indonesia would require commitment to the relevant 
regulations, and consistent and sustained effort for at least 
the next two decades.

Papua province generally has few roads and minimal electrification and telecommunications infrastructure. The use of ICTs has been highlighted as an essential strategy for lifting the quality of educational experiences and improving life outcomes across Papua. New pedagogical approaches for educational delivery underpin the Papuan vision for using ICTs in education. Teacher capacity building goes beyond merely building ICT competencies. This brief analyzes the use of TV-Edukasi (Education) (TV-E) and other ICT programs in the Province and to determine their impact on the learning outcomes of school children and adult learners. The brief also breaks down a number of policy implications and ways forward for ICT in education in Papua.</p>

Provinsi Papua umumnya memiliki sedikit jalan juga jalur listrik dan infrastruktur telekomunikasi yang minim. Penggunaan TIK telah disorot sebagai strategi penting untuk mengangkat kualitas pengalaman pendidikan dan meningkatkan hasil hidup di Papua. Pendekatan pedagogis yang baru dalam penyelenggaraan pendidikan mendukung visi Papua untuk menggunakan TIK dalam pendidikan. Peningkatan kapasitas guru lebih daripada sekedar peningkatan kompetensi TIK. Ringkasan ini menganalisis penggunaan TV-Edukasi (Pendidikan) (TV-E) dan program TIK lainnya di Provinsi dan untuk mengetahui dampaknya terhadap hasil belajar siswa sekolah dan pelajar dewasa. Ringkasan ini juga merinci sejumlah implikasi kebijakan dan langkah ke depan tentang bagaimana TIK digunakan dalam pendidikan di Papua.</p>","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/policybrief-acdp045-en-pt.jpg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/policybrief-acdp045-en-lc.jpg","","","download/collection/159-Evaluation-of-ICT-in-Education-in-Papua-Province.pdf","","ACDP Indonesia","","","Kebijakan Singkat; TIK; Integrasi Teknologi; Pedesaan; Daerah Terpencil; Teknologi Pendidikan; Daerah Tertinggal; Teknologi Informasi; Penggunaan Teknologi dalam Pendidikan; Pendidikan Pedesaan; Pembangunan Pedesaan","Papua in eastern Indonesia is a province of about 3 million people, with the majority of the population living in over 3000 villages spread throughout","Papua adalah sebuah provinsi di Indonesia timur dengan penduduk sekitar 3 juta orang, dan mayoritas penduduknya tinggal di lebih dari 3.000 desa yang ","","","8/1/2015 00:00:00","128","1","1","4","1","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:15","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

In response to demands for early grade reading, Research Triangle International has developed an Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA), which is designed to enable countries to measure, in a systematic way, how well children in the early grades of primary school are acquiring literacy skills. The tool is flexible enough to be adapted to the particular linguistic requirements of each language while retaining similar characteristics on each application, allowing for comparison across countries and languages. Two Early Grade Reading Assessments have been undertaken in Indonesia with the support of USAID.

Formulating Your Goals and Objectives 
  

""My goal is simple. It is complete understanding of the universe."" 

Ã¢â‚¬â€Stephen HawkingÃ¢â‚¬â€ 

Planning 

Planning 

Before you start on a journey, 

you need to know where you want to get into 

To get to Ã¢â‚¬Å¾thereÃ¢â‚¬Å¸ in the future,  

you need to know Ã¢â‚¬Å¾hereÃ¢â‚¬Å¸ and Ã¢â‚¬Å¾nowÃ¢â‚¬Å¸ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ your situation 

Goals, Aims, 

Objectives 

Contextual 

understanding 

Informed decision making is based on 

good information  

7 



Developing Goals 

Goals are broad statements of what can 

be done after the education program.  

 

Goals can be lofty ideas, using words or 

phrases like ""appreciates"" or  

""shows leadership ability.Ã¢â‚¬Â  

Example of a broad course goal: 

To improve student learning in core 

content areas and in the technology 

knowledge and skills critical to our 

studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ability to contribute in 

todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s information technology 

society 

How can we measure if a person 

contributes to todayÃ¢â‚¬Å¸s information 

technology society? It would be very 

difficult. That is why we develop 

objectives. The objectives are 

measurable and specific so you can 

determine if the goal was achieved.  

8 



Developing Measurable Objectives 

""The goal is where we want to be. The objectives are the steps needed to get there.Ã¢â‚¬Â 

 

Measurable objectives are the specific measures we use to determine whether or not  

we are successful in achieving the goal.  

The objectives are instructions about what we want students to be able to do.  

Use verbs and include specific conditions (how well or how many) that describe  

the educational outcomes of the education program.  

 

Examples of measurable objectives: 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ OBJECTIVE 1:  Access to high performance technology will be universal. 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ OBJECTIVE 2:  All educators will be highly knowledgeable and skilled, capable of 

effectively using. 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ OBJECTIVE 3:  Technology tools and digital content that engage students will be 

seamlessly integrated into all classrooms on a regular basis. 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ OBJECTIVE 4:  Technology will be used effectively to improve school administrative 

functions and operational processes. 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ OBJECTIVE 5:  Effective research, assessment, and evaluation will result in 

accountability and continuous improvement in the implementation and use of 

technology. 

9 



Developing Measurable Objectives 

From the general problem track backwards to reveal the causes,  

and the causes of causes, a good way of doing this is asking Ã¢â‚¬Å¾whyÃ¢â‚¬Å¸ five times.  

 

It is helpful to do this as a diagram as generally there will be more than one 

cause and many different paths of causality.  

 

In constructing a causal diagram as a group it may be helpful to use Ã¢â‚¬Å¾post-itÃ¢â‚¬Å¸ 

sticky notes so that you can add and move around your causes prior to 

agreeing on a finalized version.  

 

Focus on one element that can be practically addressed by education policy.  

 

When you have identified your causal links Ã¢â‚¬â€œ identify data / research that  

can support your deductions (i.e. how do we know?)  

10 



Tracing the Causes to Problems 

Vilfredo Pareto was an economist who 

suggested 80% of problems arise from just 

20% of causes.  

 

If you track the causes that create most 

failures in quality, you are able to 

concentrate your efforts on those areas 

which pay the most dividends. 

 

However, to apply this rule you first have to 

identify the critical 20% of causes!

The Five Whys 
The technique was originally developed by Sakichi Toyoda 

and was later used within Toyota Motor Corporation during 

the evolution of their manufacturing methodologies.  

 

It is a critical component of problem solving training 

delivered as part of the induction into the Toyota Production 

System.  

 

The architect of the Toyota Production System, Taiichi 

Ohno, described the 5 whys method as ""... the basis of 

Toyota's scientific approach ... by repeating why five times, 

the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes 

clear.""   

 

The tool has seen widespread use beyond ToyotaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Some 

consider the 5 Whys to be a powerful mnemonic for 

engineers or technically savvy individuals to help get to the 

true causes of problems.  

 

It has also been criticized as being too basic a tool to 

analyze root causes to the depth that is needed to ensure 

that the causes are fixed.  12 



 
 

Reasons for this criticism include: 

 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Tendency for investigators to stop 

at symptoms rather than going on 

to lower level root causes.  

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Inability to go beyond the 

investigator's current knowledge - 

can't find causes that they don't 

already know  

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Lack of support to help the 

investigator to ask the right ""why"" 

questions.  

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Results aren't repeatable - different 

people using 5 Whys come up with 

different causes for the same 

problem.  

 

These can be significant problems 

when the method is applied through 

deduction only. On-the-spot verification 

of the answer to the current ""why"" 

question, before proceeding to the 

next, is recommended as a good 

practice to avoid these issues.

Making Choices and Priorities 

Faced with several possible strategies for responding to a problem in the education 

system, how will government education leaders decide which one to pursue? 

                     

How to Decide Which Performance Problems to Try to Fix: 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ What performance problems do you care about? 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ What can you fix? 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ What are the political consequences of fixing them or not? 

  

What Performance Problems Should Have Priority? Ã¢â‚¬â€œ What Do You Care About? 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ What performance criteria are most important: politically, socially, and ethically? 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ What measures/aspects of broad sector goals are of special interest? 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ What sub-groups both do badly and are important? 

  

Choosing Priorities Ã¢â‚¬â€œ What Can You Fix? 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Review experience with promising policy options elsewhere in the world 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Assess local managerial and technical capacity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will those options work here? 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Delineate the costs of new policies and interventions and available funds 

18

Mapping involves organizing information in a table or matrix.  

It is useful in identifying where decisions are made/ duplication and gaps  

in decision making:

Low Impact 

Hard to Implement Easy to Implement 

High Impact Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ These interventions represent the 
tough political and economic 

choices.      

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ They represent trade-offs between 

resources and political capital, yet 

the payoff of implementing them is 

anticipated to be high.     

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ These interventions have 

consequences.  

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ If they are easy to do and have a 

major payoff, chances are they have 

already be implemented. 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Consequently, they represent the 

least insightful group of interventions.  

Nonetheless, ideas on this list are of 

premium value, because if they are 

not yet being tried, they offer easy 

payoff. 

Low Impact Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Interventions that are hard 
implement an, once implemented, 

have little impact in reducing 

attrition are waste of time in money. 

They can be quickly discarded.  

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ It is foolish not to implement these 

interventions. While they are not 

expected to have much impact, they 

may contribute to marginal difference, 

and they are generally easy to 

implement.

Strengths, Weaknesses,  

Opportunities & Threats (SWOT) Analysis 

A way of establishing consensus as to 

the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities 

and threats facing an organization 

  

This insight ensures that all of these 

issues are considering and then 

appropriate action is taken to build on 

strengths, address weaknesses, seize  

opportunities and avoid  threats.

The force-field analysis is used to 

identify and understand the prevailing 

forces, which need to be considered in 

developing an action plan.  

  

Start with a clear statement of the issue 

and clear statement of the desired 

goal.  

List those forces which drive towards the desired outcome and also the 

restraining forces which impede its achievement. 

 

Give each force a score of 1 to 4 (where 1 is a weak force and 4 a strong 

one). Totaling the driving and restraining forces gives an indication of which 

set of forces would prevail in the current environment. 

 

Once this analysis of things 'as they are at the moment' has been carried out, 

a team can begin to look at what actions can be taken to build on driving 

forces and reduce restraining ones.

Logical Frameworks (Log Frame) 
Establishing Measurable Indicators and detailing risks 

The Logical Framework Approach (LFA) can help in project design if the process 

steps are followed flexibly and its limitations are understood and addressed.   

The output of the LFA is the log frame matrix, which summarizes  

the intervention logic (with assumptions) and M&E.  

 

The log frame matrix can be used to track progress with annual work plans  

and impacts. To fulfill this purpose, diligent use is a must and sufficient detail  

is needed.

Developing a good M&E system depends on paying adequate attention  

to M&E during the initial design phase.  

The M&E system should be outlined in the project appraisal report. 

 

Log frames are comprehensive tools both for planning and implementation.  

They clarify links and expected impacts.  

They set out the indicators by which the progress of a reform is to be evaluated. 

They detail assumptions and risks that may impact upon progress.  

Log frames: are tables that link defining overall goal,  

the components objectives that contribute to reaching the goal  

and the activities designed to meet the objectives.  35

Topic #33 

 
Minimum Services Standard in Education:  
Beyond Meeting Facilities and Infrastructure 
 

 
Background: Minimum Services Standard as Manifestation of Decentralization 
 
Central governments in most countries - mostly in the developing ones - face similar difficulties in 
providing and maintaining public services and infrastructures. The situation leads to the trend of 
decentralization in the recent decades. 
 
In certain countriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ context, trend of decentralization goes in line with privatization and the 
development of free market-economy, as well as the growth of neoliberal mind set. Since late 80s, many 
governments have decentralized their responsibilities in providing, financing and managing services and 
infrastructures.1 Nevertheless, discussions and arguments regarding the forms of decentralization and 
their implementations are still open in various regions and countries. They include discourses on ideal 
and accountable system which meets the political structure, economy, social and cultural tradition in 
each region. 
 
Since introduced in 2004, the Minimum Services Standard (MSS) has become the key of decentralization 
policy in Indonesia in which aim to improve local governmentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ accountability and performance in 
ensuring basic services to every Indonesian citizen. MSS in Indonesia is a model to interpret 
decentralization which leads to the formulation of policy makers in answering key questions around it: 
which services need to be decentralized; how the financing scheme works; which is the most suitable 
configuration of institution and authority; how is the accountability mechanism or what type of 
monitoring and evaluation is most feasible and effective; and (as its consequences) what 
decentralization policy in which level will be most viable. 
 
Through decree on MSS, the central government could provide guidance and monitoring the local 
governmentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mandate in executing their autonomy of budgeting and expenditure Ã¢â‚¬â€œ be it from taxes or 
other incomes, as well from other transfer funds such as Revenue Sharing Fund (DBH), General 
Allocation Fund (DAU), Special Allocation Fund (DAK). These resources move in a dynamic path to meet 
the regional development goals that are based on local aspirations and needs, and by concerning the 
fulfilment of the MSS.  
 
 
 
 



 

 
 	

	

 
Education MSS in Districts/Cities 
 
In the era of Regional Autonomy, many aspects of services have become the responsibility of the local 
governments. To ensure the local governments provide the expected standard of services, the Ministry 
of Home Affair has prepared the Minimum Services Standard guideline containing types and qualities of 
basic services which have to be fulfilled by all local governments to their people equally. The related 
ministries then prepared more detailed technical MSS that become obligation of local governments, 
while the local governments then implemented the MSS according to the ministerial decree. 
 
The Education MSS has served as a guidance to the local governments in fulfilling their responsibilities in 
providing basic services to their people in education sector, equipped with feasible and measurable 
indicators. The current Basic Education MSS as the government policy instrument is based on Law no 
32/2004 on Local Government, PP no 65/2005 on MSS and PP no 38/2007 on the distribution of 
authority between national and local government.  
 
The fulfilments of education basic needs are indicated with: (i) Availability of education facilities and 
infrastructures; (ii) Readiness and availability of competent and qualified teachers and education 
personnels; (iii) Proper application of education curriculum; (iv) Good education assessment system; (v) 
Good education quality insurance; and (vi) Good school/madrasah management. 

 
The MSS in education sector which was released in 2004 (MOEC Decree 129/2004) contained the 
specification of educational services in the form of results indicators such as enrolment ratio, drop-out 
ratio, etc. This MSS is applicable to various education levels; primary school, secondary school and few 
types of non-formal education including a number of equivalency education programs.  
 
Because it was developed before the issuance of the Education National Standard (SNP) in 2005, the 
education MSS was then being revised to be consistent with the SNP. Besides, the MSS had not yet given 
adequate qualitative or quantitative guidance regarding the services which are needed by two main 
authorities: schools and districts/cities. Through the assessment on MSS conducted by the Basic 
Education Sector Capacity Support Programme (BE-SCSP), a program funded by EU and implemented by 
ADB since 2007 to assess and revise the MSS, it was concluded that the 2004 MSS target was still far 
from the reach of Indonesian schools and districts/cities. 
 
Through the revision in Permendikbud 23/2013, it was formalized that the districts/cities' governments 
are responsible for fulfilling Basic Education MSS. The regulation defines 27 education MSS indicators. 
They consist of 14 service indicators of local governmentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ responsibilities to be provided to 
schools/madrasahs and 13 indicators which are the responsibilities of schools and madrasahs in relation 
to the education process. 
 
With this standard, each education unit is expected to provide required elements for an ideal learning 
process with the support of the local governments. Gradually, the local governmentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ accountability will 
be taken into account to ensure the MSS has been implemented.  



 

 
 	

	

 
How is MSS Implementation and Fulfilment? 
 
Since MSS has been implemented, many success stories have been made by the local governments in 
fulfilling it. Some districts/cities have finalised or been in the process of developing road map as 
strategic plan to fulfill MSS, which will be used for annual planning and budgeting; the increased 
awareness and attention of the community, marked by the collaboration of the local governments and 
business sector to fulfill MSS; better synergy between office of Ministry of Education and Culture and 
office of Ministry of Religious Affairs to ensure quality education services; as well the adoption of Basic 
Education MSS into some local regulations such as in Gunung Kidul (DIY), Gresik (East java), Melawi 
(West Kalimantan), and Boalemo (Gorontalo).  
 
Meanwhile, the MSS monitoring system has been integrated via online system within the Directorate 
General of Basic and Secondary Education. It allows monitoring of progresses and achievements of every 
educational unit. They are some examples to demonstrate the advancement of all stakeholders and the 
fact that they understand of the importance of MSS. 
  
Education MSS Direction and Change 
 
The issuance of the new Law 23/2014 on Local Government as a replacement of  Law 32/2004 is a good 
momentum for education practitioners to review the current Education MSS. At the moment, the new 
govrrnment regulation draft is on its way for formalization.  
 
There are challenges in agreeing to a same perception, and the fulfillment of Education MSS required a 
further assessment. Are the current 27 indicators still in line with the new regulations? Does it have to 
many rigid indicators which potentially bring difficulties to districts/ciities in achieving them? How to 
synchronize the education MSS measurement result with the school/madrasah accreditation system 
conducted by the National Primary School/Madrasah Accreditation Body? The momentum will also 
expand the MSS scope, not just for primary education but also secondary education, special needs 
education, as well as equivalency education. 
 
There are some important notes on the discussion regarding MSS. Firstly, how MSS could serve as an 
effective policy instrument to foster local governments in their provision of appropriate basic education 
service? Secondly, what kind of supports needed by the local governments in order to become enabler 
for MSS fulfillment by incorporating all local stakeholders? Thirdly, how to run an appropriate reward 
and punishment system to Ensure the MSS policy are well implemented and has significant impact. 
Fourthly, how to ensure the education MSS can support the improvement of education quality through 
school accreditation process and the gradual policy towards education national standard, as well as 
regulations on the distribution of authorities amongst central and local governments.

"169","Curriculum Reform and Changes in Education Assessment System in Indonesia","Curriculum-Reform-and-Changes-in-Education-Assessment-System-in-Indonesia","<p style=""text-align:justify"">Curriculum and textbook writers are increasingly facing pressures to reflect on whether curricular design, standards, and support for teachers are sufficient in helping educators and schools to provide quality instruction and learning experiences. Indonesian education has been influenced by ten significant curriculum reforms from 1964-2013. The latest, Curriculum 2013 or K13, specified competencies in each subject area in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitudes of the students. K13 was designed to be more student-centred than the 2006 KTSP curriculum and emphasized 21st century skills. The MoEC commissioned ACDP to work with PUSKURBUK to conduct a Rapid Review of K13 in order to identify problems that teachers faced while implementing the new approaches. This backgrounder breaks down the issues found through the review as well as ways of ensuring an effective curriculum reform and developing a world-class assessment system.</p>
","","","Reformasi Kurikulum dan Penilaian Pendidikan Indonesia untuk Abad 21-Final","","<p style=""""text-align: justify;"""">Penulis kurikulum dan buku teks semakin menghadapi tekanan untuk melakukan refleksi apakah rancangan kurikulum, standar, dan bantuan bagi guru cukup membantu pendidik dan sekolah-sekolah untuk menyelenggarakan pengajaran dan pengalaman belajar bermutu. Pendidikan Indonesia telah dipengaruhi oleh sepuluh reformasi kurikulum signifikan sejak 1964-2013. Yang terbaru, Kurikulum 2013 atau K13, menjelaskan kompetensi di setiap mata pelajaran dalam pengetahuan, keterampilan, dan sikap siswa. K13 dirancang agar menjadi lebih berpusat pada siswa dbanding kurikulum KTSP 2006 dan menekankan pada keterampilan abad ke-21. Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan menugaskan ACDP untuk bekerja dengan PUSKURBUK dalam melakukan Kajian Cepat K13 untuk mengidentifikasi masalah yang dihadapi guru saat melaksanakan pendekatan baru ini. Latar belakang ini merinci permasalahan yang ditemukan melalui penelaahan serta cara untuk memastikan reformasi kurikulum yang efektif dan mengembangkan sistem penilaian kelas dunia.</p>","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/Kopidarat-34.jpg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/Kopidarat-34.jpg","","","download/collection/169-Curriculum-Reform-and-Changes-in-Education-Assessment-System-in-Indonesia.pdf","

"171","Overview of Islamic Education Sub-sector in Indonesia 2014","Overview-of-Islamic-Education-Sub-sector-in-Indonesia-2014","<p style=""text-align:justify"">The &quot;portrait&quot; of Indonesian Islamic education that emerges from this study is one of a large system comprised of thousands of institutions and millions of students, a system which makes a substantial contribution to achieving Indonesia&#39;s policy of universal basic education. This study provides a description of Indonesian Islamic education that is more accurate than and also in stark contrast to the impressions of many who still believe that Islamic schools are hotbeds of radicalism that produce terrorists. The Islamic education sub sector delivers education to around 67 million students. The Islamic education subsector encompasses General Education with Islamic features, Islamic Theological Education (Pendidikan Keagamaan Islam), and Islamic Religious Education (Pendidikan Agama Islam) at general education units. Islamic education plays a role in all types and leves of education in Indonesia starting with early childhood education (ECE) until higher education.</p>
","<p style=""text-align:justify"">MoRA education institutions are shown to have a reputation as institutions serving education needs in areas lacking state-sponsored schools, having fewer resources and poorer facilities than general schools under MoEC and delivering a lower standard of education. Government Regulation 17/2010 assumes a decentralized education system, but does not assign tasks to the district or provincial MoRA offices. Further, the current MoRA EMIS is centralized with the result that MoRA district and provincial offices do not have easy access to Islamic education data. Although several types of financial assistance are provided to state and private Islamic institutions, local government is still relatively limited. The growth in the number of Islamic education institutions has outpaced enrolment rates at almost all levels, resulting in smaller institutions, which lack resources for providing quality education. Overall, 48.8% of RA/BA and all levels of madrasah have achieved A or B accreditation due to support for the accreditation program by Australia's Education Partnership.

Qualifications frameworks set standards and criteria for a nation's agreed qualifications while also serving as mechanisms to allow skills and qualifications gained elsewhere to be recognized. The Indonesian Qualification Framework (IQF) was established to respond to national needs and regional and global trends of economic integration. In 2014, the ACDP commissioned a study team to support the development of the IQF through a study on international experiences, a study of the development of IQF in key fields in Indonesia, the analysis of finding as well as recommendations. The study also covers the road map for the implementation of the IQF, the development of Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and the establishment of the Indonesian Qualifications Board.

Underlying this goal are three key principles. First, the plans outlined in the Medium Term Development Plan (RPJM) must be economically feasible and support strong economic growth. Second, the development path over the next five years must be socially acceptable. It will need to improve social harmony, encourage community participation and narrow inequalities across regions and between socio-economic groups. A third key principle underlying the RPJM is the need for greater sustainability and the need to protect the environment for future generations. A strong, vibrant and good quality education system can support all of these underlying principles.

ACDP Consultant Totok Soefijanto said although certification supports teachers' welfare, it has not tackled the problem of quality improvement among teachers. This is due to low requirement of certification, like minimum of bachelor degree, minimum of 4-years working experience, and 24-hour minimum teaching per week. Less experienced or new teachers can easily fulfill the requirements, while ironically only 10% of teachers with 7-11 years of experience can meet the certification requirement.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> It is recommended for the government to raise standard of teacher certification in order to yield better quality of teaching. In addition, in order to reach better welfare, teachers can be encouraged to improve their skills. ACDP also recommended an improvement on the licensing mechanism and issuance of accreditation to teacher training colleges. The training should be given in both written theory and practice in class.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Regarding teacher salary, due to certification program, a certified teacher can receive up to Rp 15 million take home salary, as explained by Deputy Head of Education Department of DKI Jakarta, Sopan Adrianto. In the national scale, budget allocated for education has been increased by 47% or Rp 66 trillion within the state budget. This high budget can actually be invested in other developmental sector.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The quality of teacher comprised more than pedagogical skill, but also professionalism, social skill and interpersonal skill.

Teacher certification has not showed significant improvement in terms of quality of teacher teaching and student learning. This is because of low standard of certification where almost 100% teachers can easily fulfill the requirements. Therefore, Teguh urges the importance of quality improvement in certification program. In addition, Sopan Adrianto, Deputy Head of Education Department of DKI Jakarta, said training quality presented at teacher training centers should also be reviewed and improved.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Another challenge regarding teacher certification is the high costs of education. ACDP recorded that between 2006 and 2010, the overall education costs have increased by 47% or Rp 66 trillion. The increased costs have limited investment on other important areas, such as pre-service capacity building. Other challenges found are the 24-hour per week formula and 9 teachers in one school formula. However, the session also resulted several policy options as the solution of student-teacher ratio, such as relocating teacher based on ideal student-teacher ratio, reduce number of small schools, teacher to teach 2 subjects, and to review 9 teachers in one school formula.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://www.scholae.co/web/read/760/apa.kabar.sertifikasi.guru</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar3-11.jpeg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","12 June 2015 Teguh Juwarno of DPR RI questioned about the impact of teacher certification program since the establishment of the 2005 Teacher and Lect","","","","6/12/2015 00:00:00","52","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:15","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

As a result, gross participation rate at Senior Secondary School was only 76 percent (year 2011/2012).

The government introduced an initiative to lessen the gap and predominantly to realize the framework of 12 Year Compulsory Education by diversifying madrassa into three categories. This was raised in a Discussion of Experts and Exchange of Opinions ""Education Sector Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) Indonesia"" at the office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, Jakarta, Wednesday (21/10).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Madrassa Education Director from Ministry of Religious Affairs, Nurkholis Setiawan stated, in looking at education issues, there are three key aspects that should be taken into account, they are access, quality or governance, and significance and relevance.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Several studies proved that numbers of Madrassa Tsanawiyah (MT) graduates do not continue their education to Madrassa Aliyah (MA) because they move to general high school or vocational high school (SMA/SMK) or to pondok pesantren (Islamic boarding school) which focuses more on deepening religious education. Students that move to pondok pesantren are generally female students who wish to become Al Quran experts.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> To overcome the situation, government is reforming the system, one way is through diversification of madrassa and now is being divided into three categories. Firstly, madrassas that are focused on academic knowledge - including science - by also aiming to produce quality research papers. Secondly, madrasssa that emphasizes skills and is being run in similar way to vocational schools. The aim is for students to be more focused in exploring their subject of interest. Thirdly, madrassas with special program. This school type emphasizes on Islamic religious curriculum by providing and introducing dormitory lifestyle and for this the Ministry is planning to recruit experts in Islamic education. With such classification, students and their parents will have more freedom to choose type of madrassa they suit most.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, Consultant of ACDP for Ministry of Religious Affairs Muljani Nurhadi said, in order to run all the developed agenda, active participation and the provision of fund support from the regional administrations is required and not to only be centralized in the Ministry office.

The highest budget is actually disbursed to the regions - and from the total fund, madrassas only entitled to 2.9 percent or around Rp. 18 trillion. Another problem arises because all funding for madrassas is centralized through MoRA, of which public schools only obtain the fund from the respective regional administration office. As a result, facilities and quality of madrassas are lower than public schools.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Sub Division Head at the Directorate of Diniya and Pesantren Education Ahmad Zayadi, madrassas are supported by community participation.

The Education Management and Information System (EMIS) of the Ministry of Religious Affairs is centralized and neither the district/city offices nor the provincial offices of the Ministry of Religious Affairs can have easy access to data of Islamic education entities in their respective jurisdictions. The EMIS system has included religious education data, but it has not yet included all the components needed for developing religious education sector.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Moreover, weaknesses related to data access and low coordination in terms of plan and budget development between Local Governments and the Office of Religious Affairs led to low capacity in providing sufficient fund or other forms of support to Islamic education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ACDP suggested several recommendations to address some of these issues. MoRA can prepare and issue a Joint Ministerial Decree with the Ministry of Home Affairs, which has the central authority to oversee local governments. The joint ministerial regulation should require (not only allow) Provincial and District/City Education Service Offices and Regional Development Planning Agency (Bappeda) to involve local/regional MoRA Offices (Kandep/Kanwil) in program and budget planning used to finance the madrassah and pesantren in providing basic education services as mandated by the legislation.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> To address issues related to funding, expansion of access and quality improvement of Islamic education, policy makers at MoRA might consider using the budget in a more effective and efficient manner, through various strategic options including implementing self-returns by acquiring fund from counterparts and other stimulus funding as a mean for DG of Islamic Education to have more participatory control over the budget provided by the government.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> MoRA is suggested to request higher amount of fund allocated by the provincial, district or city government to support the madrassa, and agree with MoEC upon regulations and technical guidelines to manage the fund - including ensuring that the fund is being transferred directly through the DAK from MoEC to local government's budget post.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://www.republika.co.id/berita/dunia-islam/islam-nusantara/15/10/22/nwmh41313-tantangan-kemenag-dalam-penyelenggaraan-pendidikan-keagamaan</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar11-10.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","22 October 2015 There are several challenges faced by the Ministry of Religious Affairs in conducting religious education.

The greatest proportion of early-years education is provided in kindergartens and followed by playgroups. The number of kindergarten institutions grew more than doubled between 2000 and 2011.

Currently many parents misunderstood PAUD as a place to train reading and writing skills to prepare pre-school pupils before entering elementary schools.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> On the other hand, PAUD still faces financing problems.

Both the school principal as well as the supervisor should change their roles not merely as auditor who seek for weaknesses.

The education agency does not monitor the duties and performance of the supervisors. On the other hand, the supervisors do not know what should be done. Such condition is worsened by school supervisors who prefer preeching in theory and not being open to accompany teachers in the classroom.

Selama ini, guru honorer SMPN 199 ini mengaku telah mengajarkan cara membuat presentasi Power Point yang menjadi bagian media pembelajaran saat ini. Sebelumnya, kebanyakan guru hanya bisa menggunakan papan tulis dalam proses pembelajaran.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meski berprestasi, Ghelviny mengaku tak mendapat dukungan dari sekolahnya. Dia menjelaskan, statusnya sebagai guru honorer membuat pihak sekolah seakan mengesampingkan prestasi yang diraihnya.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Buktinya, kata Ghelviny, sekolah cuma memberi ucapan selamat saat dia mampu menjadi pemenang lomba tersebut. ""Tidak ada dukungan semisal fasilitas atau apa pun, hanya ucapan selamat,"" kata Ghelviny.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Dia mengungkapkan, keberadaan guru honorer memang seperti antara ada dan tiada.

As an education institution, pesantren makes a large contribution in delivering Islamic religious education, particularly in villages, where its service is affordable for the poor.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Pesantren, which initially focused on Islamic religious education later, became madrasah, which incorporate general education. In its development, many pesantrens built schools, most of which developed into integrated Islamic schools starting from pre-school until secondary level and combines general education in the morning and Islamic education in the afternoon and evenings.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""Some pesantrens combine both types of activities in the form of a boarding school. The existing system in madrasah, which is rooted in the pesantren culture, has been mostly adopted by general schools, which have specific Islamic trait,"" said Abdurrahman.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Given pesantren's rapid growth, the government has responded pesantren's increased role as an education institution by incorporating Islamic religious education program and Madrasah into the National Education System.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> As a center for community empowerment, pesantren have also provided life skills for their santris and the surrounding community. However, this role has diminished over time as pesantrens are no longer able to keep up with technology updates. Consequentially, the programs, which pesantrens offer, are no longer attractive; a growing number of santris receives the opportunity to pursue higher education; while the number of supporting facilities and infrastructures becomes limited.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> As the center of Islamic civilization, pesantrens have managed to add color to the development of Islamic civilization - and even to Malayan and Javanese civilization in three ways. First, the use of Malayan and Javanese as languages of instruction. By using these languages, pesantren became ""a transit"" for Middle Eastern Islamic thinking. Pesantren has also a debate and discussion tradition, thus a dialectic process between religious thinking and rational thinking of the Western world occur, and between teachers and students, which resulted in various works. Pesantren also excels in producing a blueprint for Islamic civilization, because the network of their students is spread out throughout Southeast Asia.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> However, the excellence of pesantren has grown dim. One of the reasons is by ways of scientific dialectic, a battle paradigms on the study of Islam also took place between East and West which improved the dialectic of Islamic scientific development. However, unfortunately this was not followed by improved tradition in writing. This would require a revival of Islamic education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://print.kompas.com/baca/2015/12/22/Pesantren-Didorong-Jadi-Contoh-Pendidikan-Islam-Mo</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar15-1.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","22 December 2015 Islamic education in Indonesia is considered unique.

So far, the progress or achieving gender equality in these areas is still amiss.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Education advocate Najelaa Shihab also pointed out a similar statement. She stated that one of the factors that make sensitivity on gender equality in education is still minimal is because there are very few people and activists focused on this field. ""A lot of these issues need to be disclosed, but the resource is not yet enough,"" she said.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Therefore, according to her, the availability of gender experts within the government is an urgent matter in order to implement and maintain gender equality in education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/pendidikan/2016/03/18/364426/kepekaan-kesetaraan-gender-dalam-pendidikan-masih-rendah</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar16-9.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","18 March 2016 Government and education stakeholders' sensitivity to gender equality in education still needs to be developed.

Since 2009, government investment in education continues to grow exponentially. It has resulted in an improved access, especially for the poorest areas and improved learning achievement. Although there are growths in education performance, effectiveness and efficiency, government investment in the education sector can still be improved.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The system regulates the flow of financial resources to school; but the disbursement is somewhat a potential major source of inefficiency and limits the system's ability to provide good quality education. Several studies have highlighted the inefficiency of expenditure arising from the current education system managing allocation and flow of state resources.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> One of the available indicators to assess local education budget allocation is the Local Education Index (NPD). As the 'magnifying glass' for the state to oversee the management of regional education, NPD is one valuable asset to contribute to the process of policy formulation and program, for further development in education. There are two sources of funding education, through the Regional Budget (APBD) and National Budget (APBN). In general, the regions have an allocation of 20% or more with the largest proportion coming from APBN.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> This indicator showcases the size of the regions' education investments and helps with deeper analysis to improve the quality and access to education. For example, West Java province has allocated 1.69% (Rp. 417.5 billion) of the total budget (Rp. 24.7 trillion) based on educational affairs. The amount is equivalent to 44,800 per student per year. The low investment in education this area may explain the average results of National Examination of West Java province which is below the national average on all levels.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> On the other hand, in general, the size of the budget allocation for education has a low correlation to the results of Teacher Competency Test (UKG). Some areas with a small budget have high average UKG score, and vice versa. With a total investment of Rp 44,800 per student per year, West Java's score (58.97) is above the national average (56.69).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Some countries are facing the similar challenges like Indonesia which have reformed its financing mechanisms to improve efficiency of the overall government spending. Appropriate financing mechanisms can be an important component to improve the quality of education and reduce inequalities. The information contained in NPD can be used as a base to determine funding formula and priority areas for education investment.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Regions at low grades, should pay more attention and do better alignments to meet those indicators. The current Minister of Education and Culture (MoEC) commissioned the Centre for Analysis and Policy Synchronization (PASKA) to identify and develop an inventory of regions for piloting. Approximately 100-150 regions are planned to be set as pilot area. Together with MoEC, Regional Governments are expected to invest more in education, especially on aspects with low performance. That way, MoEC would no longer need to wait for proposals of aid to support regional educational development / local school and local government would be able to immediately address their respective issues.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> NPD provides information necessary to measure education efficiency and effectiveness. It is also important to plan carefully existing resources and additional resources be concentrated in areas and issues in priority.

For example, Yogyakarta, with good educational culture, this area earned the highest average in the national exams (UN) and teacher competency test (UKG) despite its regional budget (APBD) allocation for education is placed at number five. Totok suggested the utilization of funds should really be directed toward learning activities and other aspects that support learning-teaching activities.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> To date, Hetifah saw there is yet to be an appropriate coordination in the utilization of the 20% national fund for education.

The balance sheet would also become a reference in determining education priorities.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Nevertheless, Ilza continued, indicator for the success of education should not solely measured using NPD. There are still other factors, one of them is the leadership of the regional administrations (Pemda) as well as public participation; as commitment from both parties are necessary for the improvement of education. For example, the province of DKI Jakarta and DI Yogyakarta; in terms of NPD, DKI's is higher, but in terms of education result and quality, DI Yogyakarta appeared to be better. This was raised by Ilza in ""Discussion on Local Education Index as Magnifying Glass of Regional Performance"", held by Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) Indonesia, in Jakarta, Wednesday (13/4).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Member of Commission II from the House of Representative, Hetifah Syafiudin revealed there are political interventions in the management of national education budget, as development in education generates greater attention and interest than other sectors. There are political considerations that influenced decision making on APBN. Hetifah also mentioned the low political will to fulfill the mandate stated in the Law. For example, if the House (DPR) allocates around Rp 420 trillion for education function, some/part of the budget is certain to seep.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, based on ACDP data, since early 2000 Indonesia has been showing progress in the implementation of its national education reform agenda which was supported by increased education investment. ACDP Consultant Totok Amin Soefijanto said, since 2009, reformation and increased government investment have resulted in improved access, especially for the poorest communities and several improvements in learning achievements. Nevertheless, investment in education sector could still be increased.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Regional education budget allocation, according to Totok, is among major concerns brought up in the NPD as a magnifying glass of regional education profiles. Since, this would be apparent in budgeting done by Pemda for the education sector.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Totok said, in general, regions are complied to a minimum allocation of 20 percent budget with the major proportion coming from regional transfer for education. However, not all regions allocate fund in accordance with the Law. As an example, West Java Province only allocates 1.69 percent or to the amount of Rp. 417.5 billion to invest in education - from its total regional budget (APBD) of Rp. 24.7 trillion.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Suara Pembaruan, Page 14</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar18-15.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","14 April 2016 Head of the Center for Policy Analysis and Synchronizing (PASKA) Ministry of Education and Culture Prof. Ilza Mayuni said portrait of ed","","","","4/14/2016 00:00:00","54","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:17","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

The discussion opened by Totok Amin Soefijanto, ACDP Indonesia Senior Advisor who put emphasise on the management of education budget in regions that is based on two apects; according to the Affairs and Functions. In his observations, the absorption is often sucked by the Function and we should encourage more use for the Affair to increase the quality of education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Speakers at the discussions were Drs. H. Dadan Sugardan, M.Pd - Head of Education, Youth and Sports Karawang; Dr. Ir. Hetifah, MPP - Commission II of the House of Representatives; Hj. Masyati Yulia, SH - Expert Staff of Social and Human Resources Tangerang Municipality; and Prof. Dr. Ilza Mayuni, MA, - Head of the Center of Policy Analysis and Synchronization (PASKA), MoEC.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Masyati Yulia elaborated on strategic issues of Tangerang City in 2014-2018, where improvement of education quality becomes Tangerang's first priority. According to Masyati, education is a key and as a long term investment to improve human resources excellence and competitiveness. ""Therefore, Tangerang City Government did not hesitate to invest more than 20% of its budget to improve the quality of education services, competencies of teachers and education personnel, and also on infrastructure,"" she said.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Description on education budget absorption in West Java was also delivered by Dadan Sugardan. Government of Karawang earmarked their investment proportionaly to meet the aspirational education quality. Of 4.5 trillion, they allocated nearly 1.3 trillion for education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Member of the House of Representative, Dr. Ir. Hetifah, MPP, again reminded the nation's commitment to allocate 20 percent of state revenue for education. But in reality, investment in education is still below if compared to other sectors like Defense and Security (Police and the National Army), Public Works (PU) as well as the Health Sector. "" The government is seen to prioritizing infrastructure development as way to improve people's welfare, besides the global economy which also contributed an impact. "" said Hetifah. Hetifah is committed to bring education issues on a table at the House of Representative. She claimed, ""For that, we need reliable data to support our argument.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> At last, Prof. Dr. Ilza Mayuni, MA, presented a proposition of a more focused and targeted education investment. According to Ilza, budget efficiency could be achieved by determining a more focus allocation according to educational functions, while improving financing mechanism. Cities/Municipalities are expected to do more targeted investment, especially on the lacking areas with low performance. Responding to figures released by the Government of Tangerang and Karawang, Ilza Mayuni delivered her recommendations. First; West Java Province will need to invest more in education to improve its quality. Secondly; there should be more effort to overcome high illiteracy as shown in the report, especially in the district of Indramayu, Subang, Cirebon and Karawang. Third; education programs need to be focused on improving teachers' competence, especially in Karawang and Cianjur. Fourth; special attention is required to improved student's achievement in the National Exam. And fifth; special attention to the fact of high number of school-age children not participating school. The same study also revealed by ACDP. In many contexts, providing additional funds is required to trigger further improvement. Local Education Index provides necessary information to measure the efficiency and effectiveness. It is also important to plan carefully how both existing resources and additional resources can be moved to critical areas and work on priority issues.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://www.scholae.co/web/read/1045/investasi.pendidikan.daerah.dan.implikasinya.terha</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar18-16.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","18 April 2016 National education budget management was examined in a discussion held by ACDP Indonesia, Wednesday, April 13, 2016, titled Regional Edu","","","","4/18/2016 00:00:00","63","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:17","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

Unfortunately, the program has not fully run effectively. To date, only 35 percent of PPKS alumni are actually holding School Principal Unique ID (NUKS) and become school principals in the end. This condition took the attention of education expert Itje Chodijah. According to her, teachers who have already obtained training but are not appointed as school principals could still act as driving forces in their respective schools.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Itje, teachers would certainly need to also have good leadership. Although in the end there are changes in their responsible areas, they still become non formal leaders of learners.

Highly effective school principals are shown to continually lead the redesign of their schools, provide effective professional development, engage in regular evaluation and school improvement processes, rethink goals, priorities, finances, curriculum and pedagogies.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> This was raised in Education Discussion or Kopi Darat: Expert Discussion and Exchange of Ideas #19 with topic: ""School Principals: Governance, Authority and Their Role as Determinant of School Quality,"" organized on Wednesday (27/4/2016).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The source persons participated in the above discussion are Sri Winarni, S.Pd MH, School Principal of SDN Sumbergondo 2, Batu East Java, Educational Expert &amp; Advisor Board of Indonesian Teacher Federation (FSGI), and Yaya Kardiawarman Manager of Education Quality for project of School, System and Quality (SSQ).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In a decentralized education system, the role of the principal becomes essentially important. Indonesia's Ministerial Regulation 44/2002 mandated school-based management and placed educational management firmly in the school, making the principal the key decision maker. Principals have been given a role in school finance and budgeting, staff management, school planning and curriculum development. And thus, principals need upgraded skills, training and knowledge to be able to effectively managing schools and resources.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Currently there is room for improvement. Principals are shown to be implementing administrative requirements and education policy routinely, but without the skill and knowledge of instructional leaders. This is in line with Michael Fullan's recent presentation on maximizing the impact of principals. As Fullan points out: ""There has never been a time when the circumstances for the role of principal have been more volatile. Facing the unpredictable, principals must be able to handle a good deal of ambiguity while displaying strong leader of learner qualities.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Professional development for principals is also often inadequate, consisting of little more than a briefing on policy documents. Principals' managerial and academic supervision competencies were revealed to be low compared to other competencies. In addition, decentralization may have started a system by which principals are being less appointed by formal merit and experience, than favoritism and manipulation.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Indonesia's Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) has recognized the importance of developing exemplary principals. Ministerial Regulation 28/2010 was passed to establish the legal basis for principal preparation, principal licensing, recruitment, appointment and performance appraisal. Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programs have also been introduced for teachers and include the teachers eligible to be school principals.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> PPPs are conducted to prepare those eligible to be principals. International evidence on PPP has provided insight into indicators of successful programs. Such programs are thought to have an explicit purpose, coherence between content and goals, the right balance of theory and practice, appropriate admissions criteria, a focus on continuing assessment and are subject to regular evaluation including feedback from participants, trainers and policy makers.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> PPP in Indonesia is offered by LPPKS and involves three stages of learning: 70 hours of 'in-service learning which is conducted face-to-face, 200 hours of on-the-job learning which occurs over three months and requires participants to undertake a school-based research project and 30 hours of 'in-service' face-to-face learning and assessment. Teachers who successfully complete professional learning are awarded a Nomor Unik Kepala Sekolah/School Principal Unique ID (NUKS).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In 2014, ACDP completed an evaluation of Indonesia's PPP based on the assumption that the quality and competence of future principals is dependent on the effectiveness of PPP. The study attempted to measure the effectiveness, relevance, efficiency and impact of the national PPP to identify in what contexts it has worked and why, in order to support LPPKS.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Overall, the evaluation revealed that PPP is considered to be very effective and relevant to the participants who have taken part in the program. The program is considered capable of improving the competencies of principals and the quality and relevance of the training provided are considered to be high.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> However, the degree of political and bureaucratic involvement in identifying applicants into PPP and in the appointment of school principals was thought to be problematic. In addition, many of the evaluation's respondents admitted that LPPKS could have a further review and strengthen training modules related to pedagogy skills, active learning and ICT use in learning as well as administrative instruction. According to Yaya Kardiawarman, Manager of Education for Quality Program (supported by Australian government), it requires a paradigm shift from one that emphasizes ""learning to know"" to one that emphasizes ""learning to do"".</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://netralnews.com/news/kesra/read/5617/kepala.sekolah.berkontribusi.tingkatkan.mutu.pendidikan.</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar19-3.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","27 April 2016 Exemplary school principals are considered an important factor in improving school effectiveness and enhancing education quality.

"541","Many Principals are Not Up to Standard","Many-Principals-are-Not-Up-to-Standard","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">27 April 2016</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Most school principals are not in compliance with the required competency standard. Only 10 percent own School Principal ID (NUKS), when in fact Minister of Education and Culture Regulation (Permendikbud) No. 13/2007 requires school principals to own NUKS. Data of the Education Sector Analysis and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) Indonesia shows, from the 10 percent of school principals who own NUKS, only two percent are graduates of the School Principal Preparation Program (PPP) in 2014/2015. PPP was carried out by the Institute for Development and Empowerment of School Principals (LPPKS) under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and Culture.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ACDP Consultant Totok Amin is aware that although it is mandatory, in its implementation, it should be understandable that it would be impossible to immediately have a school principal who does not own NUKS fired or resign. According to him, the unequal ownership of NUKS is not independent from the lack of uniformity in the school principal appointment program. Data of Australia's Education Partnership with Indonesia School System and Quality (SSQ) declared only 147 regencies and cities took part in the PPKS to prepare their local school principals.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Other regions have their own programs in school principal appointment. Pontianak, for example, prioritizes teacher achievements during school principal promotion. For example, if they are successfully bringing the school to win prestigious academic competitions.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Principal Preparation Program (PPP) graduates appointed to be principals will directly be given NUKS. Exception might apply if the school principals are appointed without prior PPP system. Currently, principals' promotion is fully under local government authority including whether appointing PPP graduates or outside PPP almuni as principals.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Totok hoped the government could ensure all school principals obtain NUKS in 2030 though it sounds ambitious. The target would require all school principals to go through PPP. This effort would involve approximately 14 thousand school principals' candidates finishing PPPsand obtain NUKS from 2016 to 2030. This target would also require 117 main trainers and 550 additional assessors every year.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""The target could be accelerated if LPPKS was changed by, for example opening branches throughout Indonesia, and not solely in Solo. In addition, LPPKS could also endorse online learning system that allows potential school principals to attend the program without coming to the institute,"" said Totok. Regional governments, Totok added, could possibly have their own program as long as in accordance to the predetermined standards by the central government. Requirements for eligible school principal are D4/S1 education graduates, at least 5 years of experiences in teaching, aged less than 50 years old and owning teacher and principal certificate.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Now is no longer the right time to centralize but the regions could not do their own program without considering relevant standard of quality teacher qualified to be school principals. This is to keep the quality of education standard throughout Indonesia.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Education expert Itje Chodijah said, not owning NUKS is actually not a problem for school principals as long as they have competencies as leaders in that they never run out of innovations and energy to improving the school. Itje also mentioned qualified teachers would never be bothered to be or not to be school principals after attending PPP. With a good competence and attitude, those teachers could be prepared to become inspiring figures in the education development. Teachers, in this case, could also bring better atmosphere for their surrounding environment.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Itje suggested the government to initiate a School Principal Work Conference or Musyawarah Kerja Kepala Sekolah (MKKS) for the regions. The MKKS learning system is community-based that is suitable for regions with limited access. MKKS can be fostered by experts who are competent in education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Itje added, education is a daily business and not conditional. If the individual is equipped with good quality and planning, promotion would be a matter. For the central government's policy could not be fully applied in the regions, then the regions need to create their own method in improving quality of school principals by establishing alliance with universities - for instance.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://www.harnas.co/2016/04/28/banyak-kepsek-tak-sesuai-standar</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar19-17.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","27 April 2016 Most school principals are not in compliance with the required competency standard.

This NUKS indicates the feasibility of a teacher to become school principals. According to Component 2 Manager of Australia-Indonesia Education Partnership in School System and Quality (SSQ) in Indonesia, Yaya Kardiawarman, the number of school principals who have NUKS is only between 1.2 to 2.1 percent. Yaya mentioned this in an education discussion at the Ministry of Education and Structure (MoEC), Jakarta, Wednesday (27/4). The figure is based on data from the Institute for the Development and Empowerment of School Principals (LPPKS) in 2014/2015.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> LPPKS is one way of implementing the School Principal Preparation Program (PPKS). PPKS itself is the government's effort in shaping an eligible and committed school principals. This is in accordance with Minister of Education Regulation (Permendiknas) No. 28/2015 concerning preparation, certification, selection, and promotion as well as assessment of school principal performance. Feasible teachers are included in training and series of tests through PPP and Sustainable Professional Development programs.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Yaya added, teachers participated in the LPPKS will be given NUKS and afterward they are ready to be employed in each region. However, in reality there are many school principals who are not graduates of LPPKS. According to Yaya, only 35 percent of LPPKS graduates successfully sit as school principal. Even though the rest are already hold NUKS, he continued.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Yaya saw this as a condition resulted from the governance of the respective regional administrations. They have the policy of directly appointing a school principal. This is not independent from political interests. Responding to that, Yaya said, LPPKS in concept has actually already anticipated it. The regions cannot send teachers to be trained in LPPKS beyond what is needed.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Basically, each district or city has a cooperation with LPPKS to determine the need projection of school principals for the following two years in each region. But in reality, there are many LPPKS graduates have not been promoted to be school principals.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Yaya said, principals' promotion within Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) are under local government authority while that within Religion Department are under the Provincial Government. And clearly the promotion would be based on decree letter.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, education expert Itje Chodijah saw, although teachers with NUKS do not become school principals, they can still become leaders of learning in school, in informal position as a driving force in each school. According to Itje, the quality of school principals' character should certainly be observed/studied. In other words, the personal competences of school principals should be properly met.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In the same occassion, Principal of SD Negeri Sumbergondo 2, Batu, East Java, Sri Winarni disclosed the way to anticipate if school principals are moved, yet they have good programs. According to her, involving the school committee in the program is one way. So when the school principal is moved (to another school/position), the good programs could still continue.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://www.republika.co.id/berita/koran/didaktika/16/04/28/o6c3k616-banyak-kepsek-tak-punya-nuks</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar19-18.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","27 April 2016 Teachers who successfully complete the professional learning to become school principals will be given School Principal Unique ID (NUKS)","","","","4/27/2016 00:00:00","59","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:17","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

""When I was appointed a school principal here, the teachers and students were no discipline. At 6.30 in the morning was none of teachers coming until 07.30 and neither were students, while the class normally starts at 07.00,"" explained Sri to Okezone after Kopi Darat Educational Discussion ACDP held in MoEC, Jakarta, Wednesday (27/4/2016).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Initially, Sri, a mother of three children, was confused what to do first, renovating school building or focusing on human resources. Finally, she decided to change the mind set of either teachers or students first, for these were considered difficult, to face those who got accustomed to be usually indiscipline. She admitted to experience more of sadness and anxiety than happiness but thank God by sharing efforts with other teachers and communities, changes are happening. ""Many children are interested in our school and they feel comfortable studying there,"" she said.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sri was appointed a school principal from the Principal Preparation Program (PPP), meaning that she had to proceed several selection phases before the appointment. Prior to that, Sri, born on 3 December 1953, had to wait for a year. ""I registered upon the offer. I was motivated to change education in a school and took a pity of student who has been learning in fixed pattern of sit, listen, note and do assignment. I followed the selection and finally passed on"". At school, other than a monotonous learning, many naughty students are also found. Fortunately, she had her strategy to handle it. Instead of giving strict punishment, Sri preferred to apply psychological approach.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""I talked with students of what they exactly wanted and so did with the parents. Educating elementary school children is not easy as the approach will be different one to another. For example, year 1 needs more diligent and patient teacher. Middle year student including year II and IV needs more independent learning while year VI needs to learn to be discipline in both learning and attendance especially for facing the final term of study,"" explained Sri.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> To make school management better, Sri established partnership with USAID PRIORITAS. Through this partnership, teachers are provided trainings on management or on reading habit. They are included into a two-month workshop. Sri added, ""No changing result was found except in year VI that applied active learning. Seeing this, then I applied moving class model so that teachers could possibly evaluate learning outcome together."" Other student habit is reading for 15 minutes before entering the class. This grows student's interest to reading and respectively prefers buying books than toys. Active learning method enables students freely express ideas and makes responses to teacher's explanation during class activity.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> By the strong spirit of the school principal, the elementary school located around the feet of Arjuna Mountain, has succeeded to be a referral school and recommended by Education Agency of Batu City or even by East Java Province. Furthermore, the students of SDN Sumbergondo 2 started to show achievements like being at the first rank of UASBN in sub district level, Winner 1 Poem Making and Reading in City level and Winner 1 Story Telling in City level. Sri said, ""To me, the role and function of a school principal is as partner. The principal will encourage teachers to devote their work and students to develop their talents.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://bharatanews.id/2016/04/cerita-kepsek-sulap-sekolah-pinggiran-jadi-unggulan/</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar19-25.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","28 April 2016 Being a school principal in a big city will obviously be easier than that in a rural area located around the feet of the mountain and wi","","","","4/28/2016 00:00:00","58","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:17","0/0/0000 00:00:00"
"549","Only 10 Percent of Principals are Certified","Only-10-Percent-of-Principals-are-Certified","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">28 April 2016</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Only 10% of school principals in Indonesia are certified. Actually, according to Minister of Education Regulation (Permendiknas) Number 13/2007 on School Principal Competency Standard, a school principal of SD/MI, SMP/MTs and SMA/MA must be certified. Certified school principals are identified if they own school principal unique ID (NUKS). NUKS is an evidence of school principal certification. In 2014/2015, data of Institute for Development and Empowerment of School Principals (LPPKS) showed only 1.2%-2.1% school principals in Indonesia own NUKS as revealed by Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP). The total number of school principals in Indonesia is assumed to be the same as the number of existing schools, which are around 208,000 schools. Thus, only around 20,800 schools have certified school principals.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Senior Advisor for Knowledge and Communication ACDP Totok Amin Soefijanto said Minister Regulation outlined the qualifications of eligible school principals are D4/S1 education graduates, at least 5 years of experiences in teaching, aged less than 55 years old and owning teacher and principal certificate.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""The total number of NUKS holders and experienced Principal Preparation Program (PPP) is only 10% or equal to 20,000 people. Out of that number only 2% of them are graduates from LPPKS because not all follow the lengthy training,"" explained Totok.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Unfortunately, from the training institute, only 35% of their graduates are absorbed as school principals in the respective regencies/cities. The major reason is related to local politics. A teacher is appointment as school principal for primary schools (SD) and junior high schools (SMP) after decided by the regent or mayor, and by the governor to become high school (SMA) principal, through head of the regency/city education agency. Hence, it needs to be further investigated, whether the selection of a school principal is solely due to politics/regional elections (pilkada) or because prospective school principals who have been trained were less suited to lead the local schools.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Furthermore, when returning to their districts/cities, LPPKS graduates are not directly appointed school principals since they need time, including waiting for the retirement of the incumbent school principals. Data derived from Education Partnership with Indonesia School System and Quality shows that out of 500 more districts/cities, only 147 of them followed PPP. Cities like Jakarta and Pontianak preferred to make their own respective training mechanism.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Education expert Itje Chodijah sees the school principals who do not own NUKS do not necessarily mean they are incompetent, and on the other hand, those who have passed School Principal Preparation Program (PPKS) and appointed as school principal do not necessarily mean to be the driving force of various active-learning activities such as what they obtained during the PPKS training. According to Itje, school principal competence is not only influenced by their educational background and training, but also by their own personality.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Media Indonesia, Page 13</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar19-26.jpeg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","28 April 2016 Only 10% of school principals in Indonesia are certified.

This NUKS indicates the feasibility of a teacher to become school principals. According to Component 2 Manager of Australia-Indonesia Education Partnership in School System and Quality (SSQ) in Indonesia, Yaya Kardiawarman, the number of school principals who have NUKS is only between 1.2 to 2.1 percent. Yaya mentioned this in an education discussion at the Ministry of Education and Structure (MoEC), Jakarta, Wednesday (27/4). The figure is based on data from the Institute for the Development and Empowerment of School Principals (LPPKS) in 2014/2015.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> LPPKS is one way of implementing the School Principal Preparation Program (PPKS). PPKS itself is the government's effort in shaping an eligible and committed school principals. This is in accordance with Minister of Education Regulation (Permendiknas) No. 28/2015 concerning preparation, certification, selection, and promotion as well as assessment of school principal performance. Feasible teachers are included in training and series of tests through PPP and Sustainable Professional Development programs.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Yaya added, teachers participated in the LPPKS will be given NUKS and afterward they are ready to be employed in each region. However, in reality there are many school principals who are not graduates of LPPKS. According to Yaya, only 35 percent of LPPKS graduates successfully sit as school principal. Even though the rest are already hold NUKS, he continued.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Yaya saw this as a condition resulted from the governance of the respective regional administrations. They have the policy of directly appointing a school principal. This is not independent from political interests. Responding to that, Yaya said, LPPKS in concept has actually already anticipated it. The regions cannot send teachers to be trained in LPPKS beyond what is needed.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, education expert Itje Chodijah saw, although teachers with NUKS do not become school principals, they can still become leaders of learning in school, in informal position as a driving force in each school. According to Itje, the quality of school principals' character should certainly be observed/studied. In other words, the personal competences of school principals should be properly met.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In the same occassion, Principal of SD Negeri Sumbergondo 2, Batu, East Java, Sri Winarni disclosed the way to anticipate if school principals are moved, yet they have good programs. According to her, involving the school committee in the program is one way. So when the school principal is moved (to another school/position), the good programs could still continue.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Republika, Page 5</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar19-27.jpeg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","28 April 2016 Teachers who successfully complete the professional learning to become school principals will be given School Principal Unique ID (NUKS)","","","","4/28/2016 00:00:00","59","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:17","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

Although the current university system is considered capable of generating a desireable number of graduates, there are still concerns over the level of its quality. Employers noted gaps in the quality and type of skills the graduates achieved in university.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Therefore, many employers choose to use informal recruitment sources instead of the doubtful and obsolete official sources. Building quality assurance processes and national qualifications framework would help. Ir. Surono, M.Phil., Chairman of Harmonization and Institutional Commission of Professional Certification National Board (BNSP) said the increasingly rapid movement of goods, services, capital, technology and skills, many countries are keen to implement a qualification framework to improve the mobility of their workers globally.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Qualification framework is also a mechanism to allow the skills and qualifications earned by the learners to gain recognition. Standard and criteria covered in the qualification framework are based on learning outcomes which include knowledge, skills, and ability of the qualification holder to apply it.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The three key players in the development of the Indonesian National Qualifications Framework (KKNI) are the Ministry of Education and Culture, Ministry of Manpower, and Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education. KKNI implementation stages vary among various sectors in Indonesia. Certification is common in vocational fields such as polytechnic, but the application of learning outcomes is something relatively new in higher education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In 2014, ACDP supported KKNI development by studying the experiences of other countries, the process of KKNI development in key sectors in Indonesia, analysis of the study findings as well as the provision of recommendations. Such study also includes the KKNI implementation roadmap, recognition/ acknowledgement of past learning (RPL) and the establishment of the Indonesian National Qualifications Board (BKNI).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Abdul Malik, Lead Advisor of ACDP, said there are many cocerns raised in the ACDP report related to KKNI such as lack of coordination among relevant ministries, resulting in cost overrun, overlapping regulations and inefficient bureaucracy. Relevant stakeholders, including business people, are oftentimes not involved in the development of learning outcomes in the qualification framework, so that the learning outcomes set tend to be irrelevant with the workplace. Malik added, many industries have set competency standards, this is seen as an advantage but also at the same time as a challenge in terms of aligning such standards with KKNI. And in many sectors, learning outcomes set by education providers compete with the competencies demanded by employers.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> To address above challenges, it was recommended to establishing an Indonesian National Qualifications Board or Badan Kualifikasi Nasional Indonesia (BKNI), to coordinate all activities related to KKNI and ensure integrated efforts, particularly to face the ASEAN free market.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://swa.co.id/business-strategy/indonesia-butuh-kerangka-kualifikasi-untuk-tingkatkan-daya-saing</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar20-1.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","11 May 2016 Nationally, Indonesia faces employment challenges, including the inconsistencies of education outcomes, as well as professional and skills","","","","5/11/2016 00:00:00","55","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:17","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

The standards and criteria which comprise qualifications frameworks are based on learning outcomes, which are expressed as what a graduate or qualification holder knows, can do, and can apply in contexts such as the workplace or further learning. Basing qualifications on learning outcomes has placed new emphasis on assessment and has allowed people to achieve qualifications through different pathways which may not all be based on formal learning.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Presidential Regulation 8/2012 on the Indonesian Qualification Framework (IQF) was enacted in 2012 and stipulated a hierarchy of 9 qualification levels to allow comparison of the outcomes of formal, non-formal and informal education as well as work experience. The three main players are the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC), Ministry of Manpower (MoM) and the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education (MoRTHE). The current stage of implementation of IQF varies among different sectors in Indonesia. In 2014, the ACDP commissioned a study team to support the development of the IQF through a study on international experiences, a study of the development of IQF in key fields in Indonesia, the analysis of finding as well as recommendations. The study also covers the road map for the implementation of the IQF, the development of Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and the establishment of the Indonesian Qualifications Board.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Nationally, Indonesia faces manpower challenges including a mismatch between professional and skills education and training outcomes and workforce needs. University graduates with similar qualifications often have acquired considerably different sets of skills and knowledge, and there are large variations in standards. Many employers, therefore, use informal sources of recruitment rather than official sources, which are not trusted and considered to be out of date or not relevant.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The establishment of the ASEAN economic community (AEC) in 2015 was a milestone in integrating ten Southeast Asian nations into a single market. AEC areas of cooperation include human resources development, capacity building and recognition of professional qualifications, and in 2015 member countries endorsed the ASEAN Qualifications Reference Framework (AQRF). To facilitate the mobility of professionals and skilled labour, ASEAN Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) will be established for each of the 12 priority sectors that have been selected to enter the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). There are currently 3 sectors in Indonesia that have completed their MRAs out of the agreed 12, which include Nursing Services, Medical Practitioners and Tourism Professionals. However, according to the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Sector, the Indonesian labour market is still considered unprepared to face the ASEAN Economic Community.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a process conducted by formal institutions to assess skills and knowledge acquired outside these institutions to recognize a competence against formal standards or competencies. RPL allows access to formal education while advocating the upgrading of skills and knowledge and acknowledging quality equivalences between education institutions. In the employment sector, RPL is used to equate job qualifications and competencies between training providers and work places. MoRTHE has developed an initial plan for RPL, and in 2013 the DG of Higher Education began a pilot program in selected programmes in public polytechnics.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> A national skill training system was developed in Indonesia in 2003, after the Law on Manpower was enacted and competency standards had been implemented in the skills training sector for nine years before the Presidential decree on IQF was issued. In 2014, 7,580 private providers were registered under MoM, and 12,591 under MoEC. The challenge facing these providers is to adjust established structures and learning outcomes to comply with the IQF. The National Agency for Professional Certification under MoM is responsible for carrying out certification. Many higher education institutions are also licensed to certify their graduates on behalf of professional associations. In specific sectors such as health, however, a national exit examination is organized by the relevant professional association. By the end of 2014, BNSP licensed 137 LSPs, mostly in manufacturing, services, tourism, and general workers (including migrant workers). Challenges and recommendations related to IQF as in the backgrounder were mentioned.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://www.sindotrijaya.com/news/detail/11532/kopi-darat-kongkow-pendidikan-diskusi-ahli-dan-tukar-pendapat-20#.Vz7UUTV97IU</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar20-2.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","11 May 2016 Qualifications frameworks set standards and criteria for a nation's agreed qualifications while also serving as mechanisms to allow skills","","","","5/11/2016 00:00:00","66","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:17","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

As a result, it was difficult for industries to be confident with the quality of university graduates.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Accordingly, some industries preferred to use other recruitment sources that have already set the standards of competency. It appears ad an advantage but at the same time a challenge to conform the standards according to the KKNI.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Team leader of ACDP Study on the National Qualification Framework Implementation Support, Bagyo Y Moeliohardjo said the underlying cause of the incompatibility was, in many cases, learning output that is merely/one-sidedly determined by the education sector. It was asserted by Bagyo in an expert discussion titled 'the National Qualification Framework: Determining Indonesia's Competitiveness' held in the Education and Culture Ministry building in Jakarta on Wednesday (11/5).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Bagyo said it was important for vocational universities to have lecturers that have practical experiences in industries.

"565","Family Education: A New Sphere","Family-Education:-A-New-Sphere","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">25 May 2016</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>Why Parental Involvement in Education is Important</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Parents, or other primary caregivers, have the most direct and powerful influence on a child's well-being related to his or her physical, cognitive, psycho-social and emotional development. For their optimal development, each child need at least one primary caregiver whom he or she trusts and is close to. But parents are not the only ones responsible for children's welfare. The state and communities also play important roles because a child's interactions with his or her family and the wider environment will shape the child's development. The United Nations' Convention on the Rights of Child in 1990 and the 2013 Presidential Regulation in 2013 on Holistic, Integrated Early Childhood Development (HI-ECD) has set the framework that calls for the involvement of the state, agencies and communities.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> There is still very little research on the link between parenting styles and child outcomes but what little there are points compellingly to the critical importance of parental involvement in a child's education. A study by Harlen et. Al. found that parents' active role and partnership in their children learning can improve their children's progress and success. Another study by the World Bank also found better parenting knowledge and abilities has a positive correlation with their children's development and learning outcomes. In another study by the World Bank, it was also argued that student learning outcomes can be improved by better communication between school and parents and by encouraging parents to participate in monitoring what is going on in their child's school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>What Family Education Really Is</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Family education may be known under different terms and may take different forms, ranging from parenting programs, parent education and so on. However, the aim of family education or parenting education is clear: which is to improve the child and the family's well-being by creating awareness of the importance of the parents' roles and improving their contribution in children's development and success. Family education is also of course closely related to early childhood development. Early Childhood Development (ECD) interventions include educating and supporting parents, developing the capacities of caregivers, and using mass communication to enhance parents and caregivers' knowledge and practice. It is within this perspective that the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) established the new Directorate of Family Education Fostering under the Directorate General of Early Childhood and Community Education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The Directorate of Family Education Fostering (Direktorat Pembinaan Pendidikan Keluarga/DPPK) was established to increase parental involvement and contribution to education. According to the Roadmap of Family Education, the Directorate will partner with 33,000 education units across Indonesia from which 3,000 education units will be selected to become model education units. These model education units will also receive facility and infrastructure support and capacity development.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Several ministries in Indonesia have provided services to improve child and family well-being in children's early years as mandated by the Presidential Regulation on HI-ECD. Before the establishment of Directorate for Parenting Education in MoEC, several state bodies (including the Ministry of Health, the National Board on Family Planning, and the Ministry of Social Affairs) and international NGOs (including Plan Indonesia, Save the Children and World Vision) have operated programs related to family education. Kelas Ibu (Mother Class), which was run by the Ministry of Health, is provided for pregnant mothers and mothers of children younger than five years old. The National Board on Family Planning runs a program for parents of children from birth to six years old and is often coordinated with early childhood education programs. On the other hand, the Ministry of Social Affairs runs two programs which specifically targets poor families.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> These programs most often offer classes to parents and many target poor families or families in poor areas. It is not known how many or which families are being served and whether the same families receive multiple types of services or none at all. The main reason for this is the lack of coordination and insufficient data. It can also be said that the majority of target families may not be receiving all parenting education services at the crucial time when information is needed the most. Not all aspects of early childhood are coordinated and there is no clear champion among the stakeholders in the various fields. However, although there are such challenges, the state has built a solid system of early childhood education services and ECD programs have increased and improved over the last decade.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>How to Move Forward with The New Initiative </strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> To produce better results, education programs need to have the right content, delivery and design components. A study by the World Bank that reviewed the existing parenting education programs and provided recommendations on how stakeholders may better coordinate, select key messages and improve implementation. It was recommended that parenting education providers should select a specific, meaningful set of key mesages and adapt content for particularly vulnerable families. The Parenting Education Guidebook and Facilitator's Handbook for Parenting Education published by UNESCO in 2011 can be used as points of reference in setting key messages.

Education Team Researcher World Bank Heather Biggar Tomlinson, Principal of SD Gemala Ananda Jakarta Jasmin Jasin, organizer of Rumah Pencerah Community Irma Indriyani, and Senior Adviser for Knowledge and Communication ACDP Indonesia Totok Amin Soefijanto.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> This forum focused on tri-education centers, namely the state, the community, and the family that must synergize to fortify children from the ever graver challenges of life. Similarlly in facing the threat of radicalism, sexual violence, pornography and drugs, the role of family that cares and understands quality education is needed.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sukiman said, actually the family education program has been carried out by various state agencies, such as Ministry of Health, Ministry of Social Affairs, and the National Family Planning Coordination Board (BKKBN). MoEC, said Sukiman, encourages the strengthening of family education through schools. The goal is for parents to be involved in children's education to shape their character and culture of achievement. Starting 2015, family education in schools covers 5,000 schools, particularly state schools. Parents are required to be involved in education by building good relations with the school as well as conducting learning classes for parents.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Heather said good parenting in a study of early childhood education impacts well for behavior, health, emotional maturity, language and communications skills, as well as cognitive development and knowledge. In Indonesia, family education develops, but access and quality vary. According to Heather, there is still no clear standard in implementing effective family education, including the issue of facilitators with lack of training in assisting families.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, Irma Indriyani said the main challenge to increasing parent's involvement is by building parent awareness on their tasks and responsibilities towards children. These parents are helped by structured training, including by making easily-applied modules. Other presenter, Jasmin said schools are family partner within formal education. ""Parents should actively participate in educating children.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Kompas, Page 12</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar21-27.jpeg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","","","","","27 May 2016 The involvement of parents in education, starting from the pre-school, primary, to secondary levels is encouraged through organizing a fam","","","","5/27/2016 00:00:00","62","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:18","0/0/0000 00:00:00"
"589","Schools Lacks Student Appreciation","Schools-Lacks-Student-Appreciation","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">27 May 2016</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Director of Family Education Development, Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) Sukiman said most of schools are stingy in giving apprreciation to Students. For the students are not given appreciation, this could demotivate them. ""Schools are so far stingy in giving appreciation for students. For example, when a student is elected a chairman of a class, the teacher should send short message by phone to congratulate the student's parent,"" explained Sukiman in a discussion in Jakarta, Thursday.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In reality, according to Sukiman, schools establish an interaction with parents only during grade promotion or student report distribution. Other than that, interaction between parent-teacher is seldom occur. Sukiman said, when children get an excellent score at schools, teachers should also inform the parent about this achievement to motivate cildren better in studying. According to Sukiman, ""Schools should establish interaction with parents and parents should not leave everything to schools."" Parents and schools should establish well interaction and be active in educating children.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sukirman indicated that not all parents are directly involved in their children's education at school. Most of school affairs are taken care only by the mother. Ideally, either mother or father should share a role and both of them are supposed to be more active in finding out about their children's school, not only receiving achievements report book. Sukirman expected parents not only dropping-off the children to schools but to spend time meeting teachers and discuss together about their children at schools.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, Senior Adviser of ACDP Indonesia, Totok Amin Soefijanto affirmed that one life values taught in family is integrity and honesty.""Instilling values of honesty should have been completed in family before children enter schools. In reality, unfortunately it is not so,"" said Totok.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>Sharpen children capacity</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Governor of Maluku, Said Assegaff affirmed, children capacities need to be sharpened namely character, literacy skill and competence. UNO has socialized four pillars in education that is learning to know, learning to do, and learning to live together. The governor said many breakthroughs have been carried out by the Department of Education and Culture Maluku to accelerate and improve quality education, for example, through movement to realize ""Smart Maluku"", preparing education map, forming Maluku Movement for Reading (GMGM) as well as affirmacy for S1 teachers. Other activities have been conducted to improve quality of students competence. The activities include scholarship for S1, S2 and S3 program, foreign language skills improvement, youth declaration to obey law and to show good integrity.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Besides, the local State provides special scholarship to respond the Oil and Gas need in Masela Block. The education program includes geology, oil, transportation, marine, fishery and tourism.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The Governor also admitted, education quality in Maluku is not as competitive as in other rregions in Indonesia. The quality of education is still at the low level particularly regarding teachers competence. Out of 32,961 teachers, 12,435 teachers are qualified as professional teachers. One of worse quality of HR in Maluku, the Governor said, is resulted from very high disparities of education among West, Middle and East Indonesian Zone as well as continental and archipelago regions.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Republika, Page 5</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar21-28.jpeg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","","","","","27 May 2016 Director of Family Education Development, Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) Sukiman said most of schools are stingy in giving apprr","","","","5/27/2016 00:00:00","62","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:18","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

The reason is, children learn and understand things initially from the home, so there is a great need to align the understanding between parents and teachers in educating their children.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sukiman mentioned parents understanding to grow children is varied, so that MoEC through Directorate of Family Development prepares family education program considering that the family is the first and primary educator for children.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sukiman continued that one of the main programs in family education being prepared is to invite parents to take their children to school on the first day of school. In addition, parents are also expected to actively participate in the school environment as well as the community. Parents are then hoped to establish an intensive communication with schools for children education development.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sukiman, in an education discussion themed ""Family Education: A New Sphere"" or ""Pendidikan Keluarga: Sebuah Ranah Baru"" organized by the Education Sector Analytical and Capacity Development (ACDP) also argued that the involvement of parents like watching art performance and other activities together with children could improve children's achievement both academically as well as others.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sukiman explained the attention and appreciation of parents for children will help grow the children's character. Currently, many parents leave the children entirely to schools and not directly involved in their children education at schools. Many parents drop their children off at the school gate. In the future, with the presence of family education in schools, parents are expected to have more discussion and interaction with teachers, as well as with other parents, for better children development.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sukiman added, later schools will get used to grant an appreciation not only to children with a good achievement but also to parents. For example, when the children are elected as OSIS committee, parents or guardian of the students will be contacted and congratulated, or invited to schools. Parents who have never been to school before will come and have sense of responsibility. So both children and parents are proud and have responsibility.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Sukiman, if the community establish a conducive education ecosystem, students achievement will also be easily improved. To realize this, currently MoEC and other institutions have implemented programs for family development under coordination of Ministry of Human and Culture Development.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Other than that, Sukiman said parents would get a guide book on how to be a great parent. The state provides information on reference through official pagehttp://sahabatkeluarga.kemdikbud.go.id/. This website will provide schools and parents the refferences to select topic dealing with family education development. Besides, parents could use the refference to request expected resource persons.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Some components resulted from family education are; firstly for children is the increase students attendance at schools, reduce of impropriate behavior and improved achievements that significantly affect students performance and willingness to pursue the study. Secondly for parents; teachers and parents relationship will be fostered through number of interactions, one of which is through phone message to notify children's achievement. Thirdly, teachers would enjoy teaching and have more harmonious relations with children and parents.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In the same opportunity, Senior Advisor for Knowledge Management and Communication ACDP Indonesia, Totok Amin Soefijanto, said the method of family development could prepare parents in educating children since they spend time mostly at home.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Totok, many issues in education could be resolved if the family is also well educated. One way is instilling the value of integrity so that children have the knowledge and ability. Everything could be conceptualized in family education. For example, students learning achievement could be improved through establishing better communications between the school and parents, and encouraging parents to take part in monitoring what is happening in their children's school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, based on a study of Parenting Education in Indonesia - Review and Recommendation to Strengthen Programs and Systems - conducted by the World Bank in 2015 concluded that the active role and partnership of parents can increase the rate of development and success of children because parents have the strongest role in terms of physical, psychological and emotional developments as well as children's well-being.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Rumah Pencerah Community, Irma Indriyani as education advocate said that the community focuses on providing training for parents and to prepare its modules so that parents could equip themselves with family education skills. This training is filled by presentation and problem sharing. However, parents awarenes is still low as shown in parents reluctance to spend time at shool to participate in parenting education. Eventhough the class is conducted two hours a week, it is only attended by 50% of them.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Suara Pembaruan, Page 17</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar21-29.jpeg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","","","","","27 May 2016 Director of Family Education Development, Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC), Sukiman said education is needed not only by students ","","","","5/27/2016 00:00:00","67","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:18","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

Currently, Indonesia has 33 quality assurance institutions and 12 national subjects training centers. Nevertheless, the Sustainable Professional Development or Pengembangan Keprofesian Berkelanjutan (PKB) for teachers is yet to be optimal. An OECD study revealed many teachers do not obtain practice and facilitator guidance. In fact, teachers are currently required to have effective learning strategies, ability in working collaboratively and having technological skills.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Head of Sub-Directorate of Qualification and Competency Requirement Planning Kemendikbud Santi Ambarukmi said one of the paths to implement PKB is through Teacher Working Groups or Kelompok Kerja Guru (KKG) and Musyawarah Guru Mata Pelajaran (MGMP). According to Santi, requests to support KKG and MGMP have long been required by the government. However, continued Santi, because it is not supported by the national budget, it has led KKG and MGMP to be in a state of limpness.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> KKG, Santi said, is capable of improving teacher competency and capacity in developing learning methods, especially for primary school (SD) teachers, while MGMP is especially for subject teachers. Santi added, in order for KKG and MGMP to be active again, the Ministry will inject funds of Rp. 20 to 50 million. Improving teacher competency is conducted through learner-teacher (Guru Pembelajar) training. That is presented, according to Santi, after teacher competency test is accomplished. The Ministry is also in the midst of preparing modules, so teachers could follow the learner-teacher modules in line with what should be learned.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, Senior Advisor for Knowledge Management and Communication Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) Indonesia Totok Amin Soefijanto said, improving teacher competency should not only be through learner-teacher training. According to Totok, there also needs to be an online training using applications on the smart phone, in order to be accessed by all teachers in Indonesia. Totok said, out of 3 million teachers in Indonesia, only a quarter of them are active in KKG/MGMP.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Indopos, Page 2</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar22-1.jpeg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","8 June, 2016 On an ongoing basis the Ministry of Education and Culture continues to conduct development of teacher professionalism.

Teachers currently also need help to have motivation and readiness as learner-teachers. Ifa Hanifah, founder of Education Policy Study Center of the University of Indonesia said implementation of teacher certification all together has not succeeded in making teachers motivated to improve their professionalism independently. This occurs because the issue of managing teacher's mentality is being ignored. Ifa conveyed this in the ""Education Meet: Expert Discussion and Exchange of Opinions"" or ""Kopi Darat atau Kongkow Pendidikan: Diskusi Ahli dan Tukar Pendapat"", held by the Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) Indonesia, in Jakarta, Wednesday (8/6).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In fact, according to Ifa, efforts to help teachers become educators who always have the need to learn/study to improve their competencies should also be increased. A teacher's attitude of always wanting to learn would give impact on the improvement of student learning quality. Unfortunately, efforts at improving teacher quality that is more affordable through the Teacher Working Group or Kelompok Kerja Guru [primary school (SD) teachers] and Musyawarah Guru Mata Pelajaran (MGMP) for junior high-high school/vocational high school (SMP-SMA/SMK) have yet to be conducted optimally.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Totok Amin S, Senior Advisor for Knowledge Management and Communication ACDP Indonesia said, only around 50 percent out of 3 million teachers are members of KKG/MGMP. Only a quarter of them are active. From that figure, most are teachers in Java and Sumatera. Actually, KKG/MGMP was initiated by the government more than 20 years ago. This path is deemed feasible and easily undergone by most teachers in developing professionalism sustainably. KKG/MGMP is a forum for teachers to discuss and collaborate in developing the curriculum, lesson plans, teaching practice, and other issues, such as teaching children with special needs.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, Santi Ambarukmi, Head of the Sub-directorate of Teacher Requirement Planning, Strengthening of Educator Qualifications and Competencies of the Ministry of Education and Culture (Kemdikbud) said Kemdikbud encourages the realization of learner-teachers.

While the establishment of KKG and MGMP was not mandatory, the government supported its existence and provided funding assistances to improve learning process and quality of teachers. The amount of allocated fund for each KKG and MGMP ranged from Rp. 10 million to Rp. 50 million. Meanwhile the selection of KKGs and MGMPs entitled to receive the funds would be conducted by the respective regional education agencies which better comprehended KKGs and MGMPs' activities and establishment.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Santi asserted the Ministry has strongly encouraged teachers to participate in those teacher forums. In doing so, the Ministry would provide specific points or credits for those who were actively involved in KKG and MGMP activities.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile education observer Ifa H Misbach recalled 'A Teacher as A Learner' program that would involve KKGs and MGMPs must not become a jargon.

In regards of budget for KKGs and MGMPs, he asked for its effective utilization for teacher trainings and learning.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile Education Sector Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) Senior Advisor Totok Amin Soefijanto asserted based on a joint study report of the Education and Culture Ministry's Policy Research Center (Puslitjak), the World Bank and the Dutch government, teacher participation in KKG/MGMP activities affects teachers' knowledge and competency and eventually student learning output positively. However, Totok said KKG/MGMP was deemed unsuccessful yet to meet expected results due to the emergence of various problems and constraints.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Totok mentioned another study from the World Bank that found the number of teachers who had developed their skills through the teacher working groups was still limited. There were some examples. Firstly, only 50 percent and 45 percent of teachers involved in KKG and MGMP respectively who develop their knowledge on teaching materials, practices and skills.

Because of the regulation, they prioritize this matter,"" Ifa said, in an education discussion titled 'What is Going On with Teachers Working Group (KKG/MGMPs)?' at MoEC, Wednesday (06/08/2016).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The work load, Ifa said, making it difficult to meet the needs of teachers to enrich their skills. ""If you are physically tired, it would be difficult to develop your cognitive ability."" she said.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Ifa stated, one solution to this problem is to change the regulation of 24 hours of teaching. For example, by combining learning methods to the teaching hour obligation.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""Maybe it could be 18 hours of face to face, and the rest could be done through active discussions with the students. That is important for building relationships with students. But how can they build relationships, if they themselves were tired?,"" she added.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Another criticism, Ifa said, is that so far we only focus on the regulation of teaching but do not pay real attention to the teachers mental, which also needs to be repaired. According to her, the existence of me-time for a teacher can improve their mental (health).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""Taking a vacation, having personal time and opening new horizons were such luxurious things for teachers,"" she added.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://news.okezone.com/read/2016/06/08/65/1409374/ini-penyebab-guru-sulit-tambah-skill</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar22-7.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","8 June, 2016 As educators, teachers are required to always acquire new skills.

In order to achieve these goals, a framework and mechanism is needed to facilitate the Continuous Professional Development (CPD). Law 14 of 2005 on Teachers and Lecturers and the Ministerial Regulation 16 of 2007 have required teachers to possess academic qualifications and to master competency standards. Indonesia presently has 33 quality assurance agencies and 12 national centers for subject training, which are responsible for the in-service training for teachers.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> However, OECD reveals that many teachers do not receive any CPD and, moreover, receive little professional guidance by external facilitators, principals, supervisors, or even mentoring by experienced teachers. Research on the effectiveness of CPD programs for teachers generally emphasizes the importance of long-term activities that are based on a network of peers working in groups.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Teacher Working Group (KKG/MGMP) in Indonesia has been acknowledged as the most appropriate and effective path which most teachers can take in receiving CPD. It has also existed in Indonesia for more than 20 years. As a network that organizes teachers to meet regularly and voluntarily, KKGs/MGMPs provide a forum for teachers to discuss and work together in developing curriculum, lesson plans, teaching practice and other issues including teaching students with special needs or teaching students using their mother tongue.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Many studies have indicated that working in networks or clusters can trigger learning and improve teaching practice. However, networks and clusters may fail to perform if the collaboration process in KKG and MGMP does not encourage teachers to reform their teaching practice. This becomes important because teacher knowledge and teaching practice which students experience every day in the classroom is a determining factor of learning outcomes.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Teacher working groups such as KKGs/MGMPs would provide better outcomes if they: (i) help teachers focus on providing more effective learning for students; (ii) use evidence-based reviews from research and data on student learning outcomes; (iii) support teachers to review and adapt their teaching practice according to its impact on student learning; (iv) are clearly linked with school improvement, planning and management initiatives; (v) restructure the curriculum of the of the CPD given in these groups by strengthening the focus on Lesson Study and building coherence around Classroom Action Research (CAR), and (vi) support them through strong leadership of school principals and by skilled external facilitators. Skilled facilitators (guru pemandu) -- who could be trained and experienced school principals -- could support local KKG and MGMP by revitalizing inactive clusters or encourage establishment of new clusters in other areas.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> (Continued similarly as the backgrounder)</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://www.sindotrijaya.com/surabaya/news/detail/11744/apa-kabar-kelompok-kegiatan-guru-kkg-musyawarah-guru-mata#.V1917tJ97IU</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar22-9.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","8 June, 2016 Indonesia is currently in the midst of reforming its national education system, presenting the opportunity to promote the development of ","","","","6/8/2016 00:00:00","59","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:18","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

The reason is many teachers do not have learner mentality so they need to be raised/encouraged.

Head of Sub Directorate of Senior Secondary School, DG Islamic Education, MoRA, Unang Rahmat said, based on several recent studies, 30 percent of schools today are influenced by radicalism.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Nevertheless, school is still the best place to help prevent radicalism and religious conflicts by teaching religious education. The reason is that religious education is able to nurture values that lead towards peaceful life and living in harmony with different faiths, especially for the younger generation.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""In Islamic Education, we are succeeded in providing children with education that leads to peace not merely rote learning. However, values such as the character of Prophet Muhammad are promoted, so that our generation will inshallah become tolerant,"" said Unang during the education discussion on Using Education for Tolerance, Peace and Conflict Resolution, which was hosted by ACDP Indonesia at MoEC on Thursday (23/6).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> He said that in order to be able to to teach students, the DG for Islamic Education has sent 29 teachers to study multiculture at the Oxford University at the end of 2014. They studied from education and ethics experts. When they return to Indonesia, they produced modules for training teaching materials etc.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> He thinks that this kind of learning method is more important than facilities and infrastructure. As a heterogeneous country, building peace all over the country is not an easy matter. Even individual differences could cause conflicts. In this case, education in school plays the role in educating students to be able to live in harmony amidst of existing differences. Teachers and principals should set an example for proper conflict resolution in school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> To realize this, he said, the role of teacher is critical. Teachers possess the power that is greater than his/her teaching method. Teachers should not only come, but also provide good and right religious education values to the children. Such values will enable transformation into a peaceful country.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>Teacher Becomes Key</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Head of Research and Development Agency (Balitbang), Totok Suprayitno also said that the role of teachers become key. Because eventhough the curriculum is perfect, if it's not matched with competent teachers, it would be a waste. Normatively, in modern education, the education mission from one curriculum to the other is to always equip student not only with knowledge, but also values, attitudes and behaviours.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""Education does not teach children to become smart, but also developing character. Not instilling [character], but nurturing. Each child basically already has a character s/he is born with. We only have to nurture attitudes, behavior and values,"" said Totok. Furthermore, he said that in facing modern challenges that is coupled with hedonic lifestyle, many tend to take shortcuts, forgetting knowledge and skills that is essentially the foundations of education. That is why in the revision of Curriculum 2013 (K-13), the government reminds the teachers once more that their duty is not only to teach knowledge, but also help nurture noble values and moral ethics.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Totok said, teachers not only pass knowledge, but also take part in nurturing noble values through various ways. One of them by having open discussions.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Totok explained teachers may engage students to discuss things that are considered taboo, after it has been properly adjusted to their age so that they can be involved and can state their opinion.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Totok mentioned this, because so far the role of teachers to educate students in school is merely considered as passing knowledge. It is in fact more than that, teachers carry an important function, including nurturing character and becoming a role model for their students.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Totok, in modern education, its mission is not only to pass knowledge and skills, but also values, attitudes, and behaviors. The values and culture of peace are based on the principles of freedom, justice, democracy, tolerance and solidarity.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The Director General of Culture, Ministry of Education and Culture, Hilmar Farid, said that society in Indonesia is essentially diverse. Historically, it is hard to say that the face of Indonesia still preserves the cultural authenticity. Hilmar said, in facing the current crisis, we should be reinforced with religion, tradition and culture.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Suara Pembaruan, Page 18</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar23-12.jpeg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","27 June 2016 Unicef and UNESCO adopted the approach for peaceful education, including providing schools with the correct education for children.

"620","Determining Educational System in Indonesia","Determining-Educational-System-in-Indonesia","<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>20 July 2016</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Merauke, Indonesia has different natural conditions ranging from the mountains to the sea and coast. The different natural conditions should become the basis for determining its educational system.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ACDP Indonesia consultant for the Study of Early Childhood Education (PAUD) Quality Assurance System Development Dr. Gutama said, there are Indonesian children who live near the mountains to the coast. However, why is the existing education not adapted to the local conditions where they live? Why should the standard refer to a building of a certain size and a number of other standards? What about those who live in Papua?</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Dr. Gutama, a friendly school is not only formed from physical standards such as school building and a complete set of facilities. Instead, a friendly school is one with the flexibility to adapt with surrounding environment. Gutama also stated that Early Childhood Education (PAUD) is the root to establish a good education in the future. PAUD period is the time when children are in their golden age, where they need to be given appropriate stimulation.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Gutama mentioned an example, ""In Singapore, the government has paid attention to education since the baby is in the womb. PAUD is considered as the foundation to create great persons in the future. Children in their early age need continuous stimulation for that.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Gutama admitted technological developments have made learning methods be more varied and easy. However, the role of teacher should not be replaced. According to Gutama, technology could become part of education, but the key of education itself is the teacher. Because the teacher is the one who would inspire the students.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://news.okezone.com/read/2016/07/20/65/1442477/menentukan-sistem-pendidikan-di-indonesia</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar24-1.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","20 July 2016 Merauke, Indonesia has different natural conditions ranging from the mountains to the sea and coast.

"621","What is Child Friendly School?","What-is-Child-Friendly-School?","<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>20 July 2016</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>What is an education?</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Many views exist about the purpose of education. Some emphasize education's role in forming children's academic skills as well as the technical skills they will need to eventually transition into the world of work. Others highlight education's role in forming a child's character and values as well as supporting their social, emotional and physical development. At OECD's meeting on Skills for Social Progress in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 2014, policy makers agreed that education should develop the ""whole child"" with a balanced set of cognitive, social and emotional skills enabling them to better face the challenges of the 21st century.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The Harvard Professor of developmental psychology, Howard Gardner, changed the paradigm of a single entity termed ""intelligence"" when in his 1983 book ""Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences"" he identified 7 different types of intelligence: musical-rhythmic, visual-spatial, verbal-linguistic, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalistic. ""Interpersonal intelligence"", for example, is the capacity to ""detect and respond appropriately to the moods,motivations and the desires of others"" whereas ""intrapersonal Intelligence"" on the other hand, refers to the capacity to understand onseself, appreciate one's feelings fears and motivations. Existential and moral intelligence were also later added by Gardner. Each individual has a unique blend of intelligences and Gardner's later developed the idea that education has the responsibility of identifying the individual's unique capacities and developing them for their constructive use. The idea also takes education out of the narrow confines of teaching skills, curriculum and testing into a paradigm of how education can assist people to live their lives well. The critical point here is how intelligence and morality can work together.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Even earlier, in the 1960s, the British philosopher of education, R.S. Peters, asked his readers to define not the characteristics of ""quality education"" but what we mean by an ""educated person"". This provoked a train of thought that concluded with a wider set of criteria for education than the mere teaching of knowledge or technical skills. The concept of an educated person is usually understood as more than just cognitive learning but also encompassing the way the person behaves in society - his moral behavior and ability to interact well with others. Peters paid specific attention to the role of the teacher and the learning process. His idea was that teachers have a moral obligation to respect children through making them voluntary participants in learning and letting them and their aptitudes determine what they consider worthwhile to learn.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Similar to R.S. Peters, Ki Hadjar Dewantara, a pioneer for Indonesian education during the Dutch colonial era, argued that the role of the teacher was to respect children by leading by example and supporting their learning. His famous proverb on describing the ideals for education is ""Ing ngarso sung tulodo, ing madyo mangun karso, tut wuri handayani"", which translates ""[teachers] in front should set an example, [those] in the middle should raise the spirit and [those] behind should give encouragement.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>What is the role of a school in educating the ""whole child""?</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> While schools play an obvious role in supporting the formation of cognitive skills such as verbal, numerical and linguistic skills, it is not always obvious how education helps a child develop into a moral individual or forms skills such as social, emotional and interpersonal skills.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> However, it is clear that schools do play a crucial role in a child's ability to form both cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Children are not born with fixed abilities, and most important skills are malleable, meaning that policy makers, teachers and parents can be strong influences by improving the learning environments in which children develop. An OECD report on ""Skills for Social Progress"", states that the relationships, experiences and hands-on learning acquired at school can effectively give children a sense of responsibility and form skills such as teamwork, empathy, tolerance and self-confidence. Schools are also young people's first experience of living and working with others outside the home, including those who differ from them racially, religiously, ethnically, sexually and ideologically. This experience can enable them to overcome stereotypes as they work together, make friends, lose friends, argue their perspective, sharing social space, class time and teacher's attention.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Furthermore, Robert J. Starratt argued in his 2012 book, ""Cultivating an Ethical School"", that the act of educating young people is as much an ethical task as an intellectual task. Starratt claimed that to educate young people to become ethical or moral individuals, the entire educational process and purpose should be ethical and have integrity. He calls the process of establishing such school the ""Cultivation of an Ethical School.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In his paper, ""Child-Friendly School- A Neuropsychology Perspective"", Ihshan Gumilar introduces the concept of neuroplasticity and defines it as the ability of thought patterns to change throughout the course of a person's life. He explains that schools can be ""Child Friendly"" by utilising this scientific research on neuroplasticity to create school environments, which shape the interactions that occur in a school in ways that have a positive impact on children's learning.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>What are ""Child Friendly"" Schools? How do they support child development?</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The concept of Child-Friendly Schools emerged from work done in the mid-1990s by agencies located in Bangkok, including the UNICEF Regional Bureau for Education and the Save the Children Alliance. Initial work on Child Friendly Schools focused on what a school would look like if based on the Convention on the Rights of the Child as turned into effective educational practice (see box below). According to the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, all children have the right to:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 1. Be born, have a name and nationality;</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 2. Have a family that is loving and caring;</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 3. Feel safe and be protected from violence, abuse and exploitation;</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 4. Receive a quality education and develop his/her potential;</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 5. Express an opinion and be valued for his/her contributions</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 6. Be given opportunities for play and leisure;</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 7. Have adequate shelter and live in a peaceful community.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Around 1997, action towards establishing ""Child Friendly"" grew along with the emergence of a more concrete definition and framework, encompassing the idea that schools should enable more than academic readiness in children. Child Friendly Schools came to be defined schools that operate in the best interests of children, providing the appropriate social, physical and emotional conditions to promote learning and identity formation. The environment of these schools was meant to protect children's rights while leading to the realization of the child's full potential in and out of school. This has meant promoting inclusiveness, dignity, tolerance, health, nutritional status and well-being as well as community support systems.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> UNICEF characterizes these schools as ""inclusive, healthy and protective for all children, effective with children, and involved with families and communities- and children"" (Shaeffer, 1999).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>What steps is Indonesia taking to develop schools that are ""Child Friendly""?</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The Government of Indonesia (GoI) has recognised the necessity of a child's holistic development and has supported multiple initiatives, Laws and regulations aimed at supporting it. Among these are initiatives expanding access to Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) as well as Ministerial Regulation No. 82 and actions towards establishing safe schools.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Early Childhood Care and Education: the right time to begin supporting holistic child development</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) has been recognized as the best time to introduce the underlying principles of Child-Friendly Schools. The investment made in emotional and social skills during ECCE is particularly important due to the fact that these skills build progressively on past investments made into these skills. In addition, those with strong social and emotional skills are more likely to benefit from investments made in cognitive skills during primary and secondary education. Small ability gaps can accumulate and lead to more significant gaps later on in life. Early childhood intervention can also include targeting disadvantaged families and involving parents in training programmes.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Harris Iskandar, Director General of Early Childhood Education and Community Education, Ministry of Education and Culture, has stressed the importance of ""early childhood [as] the right time to form character and values."" To this end, The Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) has set the objective of ensuring a year of ""Pre-Primary Education for All"" while continuing to promote the national agenda of giving every community access to a quality ECCE centre. MoEC has also called attention to the importance of ensuring equity in access due to the fact that girls are enrolling in greater numbers than boys, and the increasing percentage of enrolled boys are not completing the full pre-primary year. As GoI moves forward in achieving its ECCE objective, it will be important for it to take steps to ensure the appropriate teacher training and quality control needed to assure that ECCE fulfills its potential as a significant investment into a child's social, emotional and holistic development.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>How do anti-violent initiatives fit into the framework of Child-Friendly Schools?</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> One of the key pillars of Child Friendly Schools is the provision of a healthy, safe and protective environment. Schools are also meant to protect a child's right to feel safe from violence, abuse and exploitation.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Indonesia's Minister of Education, Anies Baswedan, has recently called attention the importance of preventing abuse, bullying, harassment, fights, hazing, exploitation, molestation, rape and discrimination in schools. The Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI) reported that 970 cases of bullying were reported in 2014, an increase from the 632 cases recorded in 2013. The Jakarta Post has also reported the prohibition of distribution and publication of certain school textbooks containing themes of religious violence and racial discrimination.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Ministerial Regulation No. 82 of 2015 on the Prevention and Countermeasure of Violence in Education Units, which the Minister noted is slated to be up-scaled to a Presidential Regulation, requires schools to display a sign on safe schools in their hallways as well as for teachers and principals to report any violence at schools. The Minister has also dedicated part of the MoEC website to transparency and reporting of violent acts. So far, 12 cases have been reported. In addition, schools are expected to have anti-violence units, which include educators, school committee representatives, psychologists, local officials and local religious leaders, and which inspect schools once every six months and check reports on school violence. Teachers are required to report to the unit whenever they suspect violent acts.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Yet, while it is easy to understand that a violence-free environment is a prerequisite to any productive learning, it is more difficult to know how to address the issue of violence in a way that best aids its prevention. Some have claimed that preventing violence requires making learning materials free from any themes of violence, hate or racial or religious discrimination. However, recent research shows that acknowledging violence is an important step in preventing its future occurrence. Teacher training has also been shown to be critical in preventing violence. Teachers need to be trained to lead by example, promote respectful relationships at school and teach students how to resolve conflict without violent means. Future efforts towards establishing violent free environments might entail expanding upon efforts at reporting and stopping violent acts by promoting means of prevention and resolution.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""Cultivating an Ethical School"", for Robert J. Starratt, entails a process, instead of a more easily measured outcome or message, that involves creating ethical roles for school management and teachers, the climate of the classroom as well as respectful relationships with students, parents and the community. Indonesia is starting to develop such processes: recently, children in Indonesia had their first day of school, and GoI encouraged parents to participate by bringing their children to their first day of school, meeting the teachers and starting an engagement in their children's education. Indonesia has taken significant steps towards creating early childhood development centers and schools that serve the holistic development of children.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Building upon the momentum that Indonesia has established will now be important. Indonesia can continue efforts to increase quality and access in ECCE and ensure a safe environment at all levels of education. It will also be essential to continue the conversation on the definition and purpose of school and education, the definition of what we mean by ""child friendly schools"" and ""ethical schools"", and the best way of addressing violence in schools. This is a critical step in ensuring that schools operate in the best interests of children and become truly ""Ethical Schools"" dedicated to developing the potential of each child by recognizing the unique blend of intelligences in each individual as well as the need to develop the socially appropriate aspects of moral behavior while ensuring the social justice and the rights of every child.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://www.sindotrijaya.com/news/detail/11946/apa-itu-sekolah-ramah-anak</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar24-2.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","20 July 2016 What is an education?

In fact, a best school could not guarantee children free of mischief acts such as bullying from the surrounding. This is expressed by a mother, Eva Simanjuntak. Her child, Michael was bullied at school when she was 10 at grade V of Elementary School, despite he went to an elite institution. ""Although the school is a good private school with a catholic background, my child became the object of bullying,"" Eva told participants of an education discussion with ACDP themes ""What is a Child Friendly School and Why is it Important?"".</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Eva continued, Michael was bullied by his friends as he was the tallest, curliest and black student for he was born by an African father. Michael often asks the mother why friends bullied him because of his different appearance. Having this question, Eva keeps motivating Michael that everyone is born with their own uniqueness.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> However, those who bullied Michael increased their pressure and later did it in group. ""They also expressed inappropriate and harsh words. They told my son, 'you are a neger, and neger is slave'.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The worst of bullying act was when Michael was pushed by his friends and resulted him suffered from hernia. Michael did not try to fight against them as his mother always tells him not to do it. Once Michael beat them, they might be injured. ""I do not want this happen. But as they learned there was no reaction from my son, they grew stronger and was on the upper-hand to the point of harming him.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""Although my son was sent to hospital, the school principal and teachers did not respond to the case appropriately. They said, what happened was children's business and let the children release the problem by themselves. Parents of students performing bullies to Michael had no initiative, nor to apologize for it."" Eva then decided to move Michael to other school to avoid bullying. This was also followed by other parents who learned what happened to Michael. The school principal is now already being dismissed from the school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://www.topiktrend.com/blog/2016/07/20/kisah-orangtua-tentang-bullying-anaknya/</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar24-3.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","20 July 2016 School environment should be a safe place for children.

Hence, to deal with uncontrollable child, we must then pay attention not only on his/her attitude but also on how the brain development affects the child - as studied in Neuroplasticity.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Neuroplasticity is originated from two words; neuron which means nerves and plastic which means elastic. Thus, nerves are flexible and easily shaped. A hyperactive child could be changed through education approaches, explained Ihsan in education discussion with ACDP in MoEC about ""What is Child Friendly School and Why Is It Important?"".</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Ihsan explained, the brain could be scanned and its result would show level of emotion and self-control. The brain scan would show a yellow spot in the brain at the back of forehead. If the yellow spot is less and in a dot shape, it is indicated that the child's self control is less than the normal level and the child is considered hyperactive.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Neuroplasticity science, he continued, would help common people understand more that children's attitude could be scanned from their brain. It is inappropriate to say that a naughty child could not be shaped better. That is in fact misleading, as the brain will continue to improve the whole life and open for being better. In addition, a right education approach would be a solution for children with this attitude. For every child has different character, the approach for each would be different as well. The approach could not be uniformed. Even a twin would have different brain development and led to different character and attitude as well.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://news.okezone.com/read/2016/07/20/65/1442446/celah-guru-perbaiki-sikap-anak</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar24-4.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","20 July 2016 At schools, teachers might find children who are unable to control themselves.

This type of attitude, one of which is hyperactive, will be reflected in their behavior at schools.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Expert in Psychology and Human Development, Ihsan Gumilar, MA explained that every human act is controlled by the brain. Hence, to deal with uncontrollable child, we must then pay attention not only on his/her attitude but also on how the brain development affects the child - as studied in Neuroplasticity.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Neuroplasticity is originated from two words; neuron which means nerves and plastic which means elastic. Thus, nerves are flexible and easily shaped. A hyperactive child could be changed through education approaches, explained Ihsan in education discussion with ACDP in MoEC about ""What is Child Friendly School and Why Is It Important?"".</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Ihsan explained, the brain could be scanned and its result would show level of emotion and self-control. The brain scan would show a yellow spot in the brain at the back of forehead. If the yellow spot is less and in a dot shape, it is indicated that the child's self control is less than the normal level and the child is considered hyperactive.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Neuroplasticity science, he continued, would help common people understand more that children's attitude could be scanned from their brain. It is inappropriate to say that a naughty child could not be shaped better. That is in fact misleading, as the brain will continue to improve the whole life and open for being better. In addition, a right education approach would be a solution for children with this attitude. For every child has different character, the approach for each would be different as well. The approach could not be uniformed. Even a twin would have different brain development and led to different character and attitude as well.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://beritaone.com/2016/07/21/celah-guru-perbaiki-sikap-anak/</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar24-12.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","21 July 2016 At schools, teachers might find children who are unable to control themselves.

Obviously, it should be supported by adequate nutritional intake. Stimulants from school could be obtained starting from children studying in early childhood education (PAUD) level. At that stage, school plays instrumental role in the development of cognitive skills such as verbal, numeric and language skills. Secretary of the Directorate General of Primary and Secondary Education, MoEC Thamrin Kasman said, to realize the national education objectives, the Directorate General has prepared a number of policies including the regulation issued by Minister of Education and Culture (Permendikbud) on Education Governance and by Minister of Manpower (Permenaker) on the Prohibition of Smoking in School Areas.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Thamrin, learning process should support educational inputs such as availability of facilities and infrastructures including classrooms and school, availability of teachers as teaching personnels and the availability of books as learning references. Thamrin said, ""Stimulants in education system will enable children to read, read and read. That could be achieved through supports and availability of time, place and facilities and infrastructures.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In addition, character building is also important through, for instance, praying before studying. Local culture should also be exposed to children to explore local wisdom values. Local songs should also be introduced to bring the children back to the noble values. Other than that, Thamrin said, school as a 'park' should be understood as a joyful place for children to raise their spirit to attend school. If a child feels hesitant to go to school, it means the school has not been a 'park' for children.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, Consultant of Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) Indonesia Gutama expressed, Early Childhood Education (PAUD) becomes the basic concept of a child-friendly school. School should provide freedom to its students, because when there is intervention, children would feel uncomfortable. According to Gutama, children in PAUD greatly need stimulation all the time to grow various potentials within a comfortable atmosphere. PAUD needs education personnel as key figure who shows high enthusiasm and sincere affection. Besides, the teacher should be a role model, who is consistent and inspirational, well, smart and noble.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Similarly, Ichsan Gumilar, expert in psychology and human development, said the success of education would depend highly on government investment in education sector. With Child-Friendly School approach, children would be exposed to best and appropriate education. In practice, child's development would also be affected by brain development. Children's behavior would be different when they are observed. Ihsan added that the brain is flexible and affects child character as shown in a hyper-active child or a child with abnormal behavior. The nerves system could shape one's personality and that would continue to happen the whole life.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://indopos.co.id/stimulasi-dan-nutrisi-bentuk-karakter-peserta-didik/</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar24-13.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","21 July 2016 Formation of children's characters depends on the stimulants, originating both from the family and from the school.

Schools have the function to protect children. Hence, children feel comfortable and safe from violence, bullying and exploitation.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Minister of Education and Culture (MoEC) Anies Baswedan has also emphasized the importance of prevention towards persecution, harassment, fights, hazing, exploitation, sexual abuse, raping and discrimination in school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Based on data obtained by Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) Indonesia, the Indonesia Child Protection Commission (KPAI) reported there were 970 cases of harassment in 2014.

ACDP Indonesia Consultant for the Study of PAUD Quality Assurance System Development, Gutama stated, to prevent violence, learning materials which are free from themes of violence, hate, or ethnic and religious discrimination are required. In addition, teacher training could be an important element to prevent the occurrence of violence in school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Teachers need to be exposed to good trainings to become examples and to be able to teach students on conflict resolution.

"645","Child Friendly School According to Geographical Condition","Child-Friendly-School-According-to-Geographical-Condition","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">25 July 2016</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Child friendly school is recently becoming a new headline and a relevant issue to discuss. A child friendly school should be based on existing condition, for example; appropriate to natural environment. It means education should not necessarily apply exactly the same standard for every region.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The education should be adjusted to natural environment standard to make children comfortable and motivated. Indonesia with thousands of islands from Sabang to Merauke allows differences in determining education system. With comfortable natural condition, the children could learn everywhere. Education in eastern and western part of Indonesia could not apply the same standard. Facilities and infrastructure required in western part might not be required by the eastern part of Indonesia. The school could make use of existing facilities in its surrounding environment to make a child friendly school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The key in education is teacher, not the facilities and infrastructure. For children to take teacher as an exemplary figure, teachers should be a role model and inspiring to students. Regardless the presence of technology development that make learning method more varied and easier, the role of teacher could not be replaced.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Ki Hajar Dewantara has actually introduced concept of education as Taman Siswa, an enjoyable park for children, and education is ideally started since the early age. In Singapore, early childhood education is started since the baby is still in the womb as the government is aware that education serves as the foundation to create great person in the future. And early age children require constant stimulation for that.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Early Childhood Education (PAUD) is the root to establish good education in future. Moreover, PAUD period is the time when the children are in their golden age, so they need to be given appropriate stimulation. To realize a child friendly school, the implementation of education concept should sharpen the children's cognitive, social and spiritual skills. Especially in spiritual skill, there is a hindrance in which study hours for religion subject at school is still limited.

"646","What is Child Friendly School and Why is it Important?","What-is-Child-Friendly-School-and-Why-is-it-Important?","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">26 July 2016</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> On Wednesday, 20 July 2016 at 09.30 WIB, MoEC is conducting a routine program held once in every two week called KOPI DARAT - Kongkow Pendidikan: Diskusi Ahli dan Tukar Pendapat / Discussion of Education: Expert Discussion and Sharing about What is Child Friendly School? This topic is interesting and new for public. The speakers are Thamrin Kasman, a Secretary of Directorate General of Basic and Secondary Education, Ministry of Education and Culture, Dr Gutama, ACDP Indonesia Consultant for Study of PAUD quality assurance development system, Ihsan Gumilar, MA as expert in psychology and human development and Eva Simanjuntak as parent representative. IMADIKLUS region 3 other than UNJ, UNTIRTA and UIKA has also the opportunity to attend this program.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Kopi Darat started at 09.30 conducted in open room of library MoEC the 1st floor Senayan Jakarta. This program was attended by many youths including practitioner, community, PAUD teachers, trainer, university students and parents. The discussion was initiated by the presentation about the meaning of education and opinions about the objective of education. Some of the opinion emphasized on the role of education to build children academic ability and technical skills required to deal with transition period for working. Education should develop human being holistically with balanced skills in terms of cognitive, social and emotional so that they are able to compete in the challenge of the 21st century. According to Howard Gardner, we might misperceive the intelligence as we often take it as single entity while in fact there are 7 types of different intelligences: music-rhythmic, visual - space, verbal - linguistic, logic - math, kinesthetic - physical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and natural. Considering that every human being has unique intelligence, Gardner developed the idea to allow education responsible to identify individual unique capacity and develop the constructive aspect of it. This perception will build the assumption that education is not about teaching skill and curriculum but a paradigm how to help human to experience the life well.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The second presentation was case sharing by Eva Simanjuntak as a child parent who was bullied by his friends at school. With a tall, curly and black skin, the child born from an African father has different appearance from others. Eva said that she sent the child to a reputable school with best facilities and teachers to get best services of it. In fact, she was wrong as her son was being the object of bullying verbally and physically. The son was suffered of hernia because he was kicked hard on the lower part of his stomach as the Doctor diagnosed. I was shocked and at home I talked carefully with my son and revealed that he was bullied by his friends. Then, I was wondering how a high class school could let such violence acts occurred at the school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Ihsan Gumilar, MA expert in Psychology and human development said that human nerves are flexible and human brain is also changing. He made the analogue of a plastic to compare with nerves flexibility that is easily developed or shaped. The disrupted children psychology can be identified from the brain structure reflected easily in behavior. Changing behavior could be resulted from nearest persons, environment or media. Many cases showed that parents educate the children appropriately but then children may interact with the environment, watch inappropriate program on TV and so on. To avoid bad impact of this, providing child friendly location is of necessary including school which plays important role to sharpen static ability and skills. The policy makers, teachers and parents could bring significant impact for better learning environment according to children development.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> A child friendly school will be of necessary to educate children with good ethic and moral. Ihsan Gumilar introduced the concept of neuroplasticity as the mindset/human brain capacity to change for the whole of life. The school could be ""Child Friendly"" by using scientific study of nueuroplasticity to create school environment allowing interaction building that positively affects the children development.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Concept of a child friendly school emerged in a work done by an institute in Bangkok including Regional Bureau of UNICEF for Education and Save Children Alliance. Early initiative of child friendly school focused on how a school has been embodied based on Children Right Convention as an effective education practice. According to the Convention, all children have a right to:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 1. Be born, have a name and citizenship</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 2. Have family who love and concern with</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 3. Safe and protected form violence, harassment and exploitation</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 4. Accept quality education and able to develop potentials</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 5. Express opinion and be appreciated for each contribution</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 6. Have a chance for playing and recreation</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 7. Have appropriate place to stay and live in the community peacefully</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> A Child Friendly School could be defined as the school that operates based on best interest for children, providing social, physical, and emotional condition appropriate to promote learning and identity building. This school environment is intended to protect children right to realize best potential in and outside of the school. The pillars of child friendly school are proactive inclusive, effective academically and relevant with children need, healthy, save and protected, responsive gender, and allows family and community participation.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Dr. Gutama, the government of Indonesia needs to develop the children holistically by extending the access to early childhood education and care/PPAUD for it is best time to promote basic principles of a child friendly school. Building strong social and emotional skills would allow more benefit taking from investment provided in cognitive skill development during basic and secondary education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> One of the pillars in child friendly school is the availability of healthy, safe and protective environment. School play a role to protect children right to be free of violence, hazing and exploitation. Hamid Muhamad said that reguulation of Miniter of Education and Culture No. 82/2015 about prevention and treatment for any violence act in educational unit would be upgraded to Presidential Regulation , instructing the school to set an announcement boards in school hall and the teachers and school principal would report violence act at school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> A child friendly school could work if all parties support, make the activity successful and ensure the school run as based on children interest to be 'ethical school' dedicated to develop the child potential by integrating unique intelligence of every individual and need to develop non cognitive aspect and moral attitude, as well as to ensure social justice and right for every child.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://imadiklus.com/apa-itu-sekolah-ramah-anak-dan-mengapa-itu-sangat-penting/</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar24-27.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","26 July 2016 On Wednesday, 20 July 2016 at 09.30 WIB, MoEC is conducting a routine program held once in every two week called KOPI DARAT - Kongkow Pen","","","","7/26/2016 00:00:00","65","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:18","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

Her son, Michael had it after being kicked by his friends as school. Michael was 10 and at Grade V of a Private Elementary School in Jakarta. ""My son with a tall body, skinny and black skin looked unique and somewhat different from his friends. He was born from the African father. There was on student who used to bully Michael and even told him that he was not Indonesian but a neger and called a slave. Having had this, my son did not fight back as I have told him not to.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""After the incident, those who bullied my son were moved from the school and so was the school principal. I was wondering why the school let such things occurred. Children today are affected by films and information technology, and respectively a child of 10 years old could make a stereotype of African offspring.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ACDP Indonesia Consultant for the Study of PAUD Quality Assurance System Development, Dr. Gutama said that Early Childhood Education and Care is the most appropriate stage to introduce basic principle of a Child Friendly School. The idea of child friendly school is the school that considers all children needs. Indonesia has actually started it when the Indonesian Education Figure, Ki Hajar Dewantara created a concept of Students Park - and not student education or student school. According to Gutama, that concept is related to brain-based science. The early childhood age is the golden period of children to be given stimuli to enable them develop along with their potentials. If a child is indicated hesitate to go to school, the school is probably no longer an enjoyable place for the child. The school should become a park where school ecosystem is integrated to support a child friendly school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Director General of Early Childhood Education and Public Education, Harris Iskandar stated that Early Childhood Education and Care is the best stage to introduce the principles of friendly school to children. Children with strong social and emotional skills since the early age would shape better cognitive skills in coming to secondary education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Ichsan, parents is necessarily to teach children assertive behaviors. Child-friendly school, Ichsan added, could be an approach to sharpen children cognitive, emotional and spiritual skills.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The emergence of many bullying cases at schools have created hesitance for children to go to schools. Indonesian Children Protection Commission (KPAI) reported that there were 970 bullying cases in 2014, increased from 632 cases recorded in 2013. The government, respectively, has issued five regulations concerning violence act at school. These regulations, including Permendikbud No. 23/2015 about Character Building, were issued between 2015-2016, intended to produce a positive education like literacy movement and parents dropping children in their first day of school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The second regulation issued was Permendikbud No.64/2015 about Free Cigarette Area at School Environment, followed by Permendikbud No.82/2015 about Prevention and Treatment for Violence Acts at Educational Unit Environment. The other two regulations is Permendikbud No.8/2016 about Books Used in Educational Unit. The books should meet the criteria before use and distributed in educational units. The last is Permendikbud No. 18/2016 about Induction to School Environment as the replacement of Student Orientation Day (MOS) which was often filled by violence act of the senior to junior students.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> https://issuu.com/e_papermetroandalas/docs/513</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar24-28.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","27 July 2016 Eva Simanjuntak still vividly remembers when her son was hospitalized of hernia.

The different natural conditions should become the basis for determining its educational system.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ACDP Indonesia consultant for the Study of Early Childhood Education (PAUD) Quality Assurance System Development Dr. Gutama said, there are Indonesian children who live near the mountains to the coast. However, why is the existing education not adapted to the local conditions where they live? Why should the standard refer to a building of a certain size and a number of other standards? What about those who live in Papua?</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Dr. Gutama, a friendly school is not only formed from physical standards such as school building and a complete set of facilities. Instead, a friendly school is one with the flexibility to adapt with surrounding environment. Gutama also stated that Early Childhood Education (PAUD) is the root to establish a good education in the future. PAUD period is the time when children are in their golden age, where they need to be given appropriate stimulation.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Gutama mentioned an example, ""In Singapore, the government has paid attention to education since the baby is in the womb. PAUD is considered as the foundation to create great persons in the future. Children in their early age need continuous stimulation for that.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Gutama admitted technological developments have made learning methods be more varied and easy. However, the role of teacher should not be replaced. According to Gutama, technology could become part of education, but the key of education itself is the teacher.

This type of attitude, one of which is hyperactive, will be reflected in their behavior at schools.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Expert in Psychology and Human Development, Ihsan Gumilar, MA explained that every human act is controlled by the brain. Hence, to deal with uncontrollable child, we must then pay attention not only on his/her attitude but also on how the brain development affects the child - as studied in Neuroplasticity.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Neuroplasticity is originated from two words; neuron which means nerves and plastic which means elastic. Thus, nerves are flexible and easily shaped. A hyperactive child could be changed through education approaches, explained Ihsan in education discussion with ACDP in MoEC about ""What is Child Friendly School and Why Is It Important?"".</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Ihsan explained, the brain could be scanned and its result would show level of emotion and self-control. The brain scan would show a yellow spot in the brain at the back of forehead. If the yellow spot is less and in a dot shape, it is indicated that the child's self control is less than the normal level and the child is considered hyperactive.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Neuroplasticity science, he continued, would help common people understand more that children's attitude could be scanned from their brain. It is inappropriate to say that a naughty child could not be shaped better. That is in fact misleading, as the brain will continue to improve the whole life and open for being better. In addition, a right education approach would be a solution for children with this attitude. For every child has different character, the approach for each would be different as well. The approach could not be uniformed. Even a twin would have different brain development and led to different character and attitude as well.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://emadink.com/read/detail/9065</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar24-30.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","July 2016 At schools, teachers might find children who are unable to control themselves.

Daliman Sofyan, M.Pd., Chairman of Indonesia School Supervisor Association (APSI) said that such test may only be given to find out children's ability and skills. Daliman added that nationally, students who enter primary school should not be given any kind of test as the policy of 9-years compulsory education in primary school only allow for age selection, that is at least 7 years old. However, parents sometimes persistently send their children to school even though they are 6.5 years old.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Daliman explained that 7 years old child is already considered mature, both mentally and in mind. They will be able to follow lessons more closely than those under the required age. Daliman suggested parents to not worry so much if their children are yet to be able to read or write when entering the school. The test conducted in school should not be the basis for accepting or not accepting a child as student. The test should be given only to find out the basic ability.

Therefore, they will need good knowledge and understanding about learning process, role of teachers and school principal and the function of National Education Standard to improve learning.

Only a few have knowledge about National Education Standard or how to make it useful to improve school and students learning. The competency of supervisors is important to strengthen the framework for a quality education and an accountable education system. The study held by Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) in 2013 revealed that Indonesia generated the lowest score in 3 out of 6 competencies.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The 3 low-competencies are academic supervision, educational evaluation, and research &amp; development. Other 3 competencies included in this study are personality or character, social and managerial supervision. Totok Amin Soefijanto, Senior Advisor for Knowledge Management and Communication ACDP Indonesia mentioned that almost none of school supervisors is able to relate achievements expected in the national education standard with the improvements of student learning. Low scores in the 3 categories indicated the lack of competency among school supervisors in providing suggestions to teachers about effective learning, including the low ability in analyzing and using performance data to improve quality and output of education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Totok explained further that those 3 competencies are very important since one of the school supervisors' duties is to provide guidance as well as to develop teachers and school principals. So far, school supervisors are focused more on administrative affairs and not on school development. It is true that there might be competent school supervisors, however in most of the regions, they tend to focus more on administrative not quality. Other crucial constraints are the limited training and capacity building sessions for school supervisors as admitted by Rojali, one of school supervisors from South Tambun, Bekasi. According to him, limited training for school supervisors affects much on their basic duties such as supervising, training, evaluating, and developing teachers and school principal. Supervisors, he said, do need this kind of capacity building program.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Daliman Sofyan, Chairman of Indonesia School Supervisor Association (APSI) mentioned that there are currently 30,000 school supervisors with huge responsibilities considering the high number of schools and approximately around 3 million of teachers to be covered. Daliman said that APSI is hoping to be able to solve the problems concerning the school supervisors, one of which is through preparing guideline for school supervisor to enable their performance in accordance to each field.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Other effort taken is by publishing an instrument for academic and managerial supervision. This is distributed nationally through APSI in each province and also through cooperation with the MoEC. Other than that, local governments should also complement the central government by producing relevant policies which support the improvement of school supervisors' competency.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Pikiran Rakyat, Page 20</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar25-10.jpeg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","4 Aug 2016 The majority of school supervisors have not acquired competencies to support the improvement of student learning.

Therefore, knowledge and understanding about learning process, role of teachers and principal, as well as the function of National Education Standard are all important.

However, so far, school supervisors have not been developed into professionals and dignified in carrying out supervision and coaching to school management, school principals and teachers. The role of supervisors in various regions is considered still very much focused on administrative matters rather than quality. Hence, school supervisor is not yet considered as a partner for school principal, teachers, as well as the education agency in ensuring the quality of education services.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Issues around the low-scale of competence, professionalism, and authority of the school supervisor were raised in the Education Gathering: Expert Discussion and Exchange of Opinion or Kongkow Pendidikan: Diskusi Ahli dan Tukar pendapat held by the Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) Indonesia in Jakarta, Wednesday (3/8).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Principal of SMAN 1 Tambun Selatan, Bekasi Regency, Endang Srihartati who presented in the event said there was an impression that school supervisors were only busy asking school principals and teachers to fill out administrative forms.

It is recorded about 28,000 supervisors who were certified as educators at the Ministry of Education and Culture (Kemdikbud). According to Garti, the challenge to improve professionalism and the dignity of school supervisors would include the recruitment system in the regions that have yet to refer to the pre-determined standard.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, Chairman of the Indonesia School Supervisor Association Daliman Sofyan said, improving the quality of supervisors through education and training is still lacking.

Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) attempts to continuously improve school supervisors' competence through competency test (UK). In line with this, Garti Sri Utami, Director of Primary and Secondary Education Personnel Development at Ministry of Education and Culture highlighted the importance of improving school supervisors' competence in the way they conduct school inspections, do school evaluations as well as their abilities in providing guidance for teachers and school principals.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Garti added that until 2015, around 80% or approximately 24 thousands of school supervisors have attended a competency test. However, the test only covered assessment upon cognitive aspects while other aspects such as personal character, social skills, managerial supervision skills, academic skills, educational evaluation and research &amp; development skills were not yet wholy covered. Garti said, other than developing teachers and school principals, supervisors should also serve as educational personnel at school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> School supervisors during their works in supervising and developing educational system, are hoped to be able to establish a good working culture at school. Supervision is inseparable from educational management and this is not fully the responsibility of central government but is shared with local governments.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Supervisors could be a career teacher who is promoted to be school principal and then to be school supervisor. Their previous career would help building their professionalism, as supervisor is also expected to be able to manage class, to read and use empirical data from students scores to teacher's competence scores to improve the overall education quality.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> At the same time, Chairman of Indonesia School Supervisor Association (APSI), Daliman Sofyan said that in dealing with the problem, at least 30 thousand of members are included in a regular training and capacity development programs. Besides, together with MoEC, APSI conducts competency test to accelerate the fulfillment of quality school supervisors.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> APSI regular development programs, as explained by Daliman, have been conducted down to district level, where each district would send their members to sub districts. While at the provincial level, APSI is assigned to coordinate members at district level. One of the activities is the socialization of Curriculum 2013. Considering these tasks, the duty of school supervisors is apparently hard and complicated; they are not only expected to provide guidance and train teachers to solve problems in teaching, but also to be a consultant in education and to solve social problem as well.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://indopos.co.id/pengawas-sekolah-wajib-diujikompetensikan-pemda-masih-abai/</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar25-15.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","4 Aug 2016 School supervisors play an important role in terms of quality assurance and to maintain the accountability of Indonesia educational system.","","","","8/4/2016 00:00:00","54","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:18","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

It is recorded about 28,000 supervisors who were certified as educators at the Ministry of Education and Culture (Kemdikbud).

There should be someone to supervise what are done by both of them, and therefore the presence of the school supervisor is very important. Totok mentioned, the task of school supervisor is not only to coach the school principal, but also to coach teachers and other education personnels. School supervisors play a key role in the framework of quality assurance and accountability of the education system.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The statement was raised by Totok in an ACDP Discussion ""School Supervisor: Hidden Link in Education Quality Assurance and Accountability"" or ""Pengawas Sekolah: Pemeran Penting di Balik Layar dalam Penjaminan Mutu dan Akuntabilitas Pendidikan"", at the Ministry of Education and Culture, Wednesday (3/8). Totok added, based on ACDP study, there were various issues related to school supervisors; such as the obligation to make a scientific work. They should be able to guide teachers and school principals in scientific writing. However, in reality most of school supervisors only record documentation, because they have to oversee such large area. They would then conduct only administrative audits without conducting any guidance.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Director of Education Personnel Development for Basic and Secondary Education at thhe MoEC, Garti Sri Utami said, to overcome this problem, MoEC had put together a set of supervisors' profile following supervisor competency testing in 2015. The supervisor profile could be viewed by regency/city. She explained, the competency test was conducted to portray their social skills, cognitive skills, and ability of doing evaluation in education. According to Garti, supervisors should be in the classroom observing and interacting with teachers and students to obtain data, as well as to preparing a plan/instrument for monitoring. She added that the instrument should be supported by empirical data, student's records, and teachers' competency record as well.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Development process, as a system, could not be handed fully to the government since there should be self-evaluation conducted at school. The role of Education Agency is also important, to fulfill the needs of school supervisors and to ensure their achievements are in accordance to the required standard. Head of Education Agency should not promote a school principal to become school supervisor until he/she passed on administrative selection, passed on supervisor training and having self-capacity to be school supervisors. A survey held by ACDP to supervisors and school principals in 2013 are used as a base to revealing that the supervisors have not been equipped with competencies required for learning improvement. Totok mentioned that this survey was held to evaluate supervisors through self-assessment, and through teachers and school principal's assessment, based on various competences.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, Chairman of Indonesia School Supervisors Association (APSI) Daliman Sofyan, said the presence of APSI is to deal with deadlocks in various areas, as well as to facilitate school supervisors in facing their problems, and help them running their tasks and functions more appropriately.

The result of survey showed that the level of tolerance among the religions followers in Indonesia is quite high (75,36 of 100) compared to previous result of survey in 2012. This was raised by Head of Research, Development, Education, and Training of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, Prof. H. Abdurrahman Mas'ud, Ph.D in KOPI DARAT initiated by Education Sector Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) Indonesia with topic of ""Managing Differences and Maintaining Tolerance Through Education"" held in QQ Kopitiam Mall FX.

Other</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> than Head of Research and Development and Education and Training, this event was also attended by Head of Research and Development Center for Religious Life, representatives of Universities lecturer, stakeholders, education observers, researchers of Research and Development Center for Religious Life, and mass media. The speakers of the event are Prof. H. Abdurrahman Mas'ud, Ph.D (Head of Research Development and Education Training); Dr. H. Amin Haedari (Expert of Islamic Education and Former Director of Islamic Education Directorate of Islamic Education of the Ministry of Religious Affairs); Ahmad Suaedy, MA (Representative from Abdurrahman Wahid Center, UI currently working in Ombudsman); Prof. Muljani A. Nurhadi, M.Ed. (Lead Advisor for Ministry of Religious Affairs ACDP Indonesia); and Meiske Yoe (Representative of Initiative Team of Sabang Merauke Community).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In this occasion, Mas'ud explained that in some regions like NTT, Singaraja City, Bali District, and Papua, tolerant culture among the religions followers has been inherited from the ancestors. However, this tolerance has not been permanently established but dynamic and need continuous effort to establish it. ""In general, Indonesia is a friendly and tolerant nation so that if a clash on religion is indicated in one of Indonesia Regions, it is merely case-based. The survey revealed three indicators highly appreciated by respondents namely the education on equity, tolerance and team work, so that attentions should be given to those three aspects.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, Dr.H. Amin Haedari, M.Pd explained that Islamic Education plays significant role to promote tolerance and to respect each other among the religion followers, and to maintain harmony that represent Islam as the blessing for the universe (rahmatan lil alamin). Education for tolerance (tasamuh fit tarbiyah) is implemented by internalizing children understanding of character building at early stage and instilling moral and cultural values across primary, secondary and Higher Education Schools. Therefore, Amin said, managing attitude towards differences by expressing understanding and showing respect is our shared task.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Ahmad Suaedy, MA explained that intolerance among public schools' students across primary to higher education level grows due to the lack of understanding towards a comprehensive Islamic rahmatan lil 'alamin (syamil and Mutakamil). He added that peace and love movement should be grown among the students by, for instance, pay respect to local wisdom, preserving religious tradition and noble culture, of Islamic scholars in interpreting the meaning of patience, thankful and sincerity.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Link http://balitbangdiklat.kemenag.go.id/posting/read/1425-Kerukunan-Umat-Beragama-di-Indonesia-Cukup-Tinggi</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar26-10.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","Date 14 Sept 2016 In 2015, Center of Research and Development for Religious Life, Ministry of Religious Affairs, conducted a survey to measure and obs","","","","9/14/2016 00:00:00","60","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:18","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

It is the time for education to search for local wisdoms that it is not far from the life of local communities. That was one of the topics in ""Gathering on Education Topics: Brainstorm and Discussion with Experts"" or Kopi Darat, Wednesday (9/14).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Head of Research, Development, Education and Training of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, Abdul Rahman Masud, said that since 2010 the Ministry has released survey on Religious Tolerance, which highlights three main variables, namely tolerance, equality and cooperation. The highest scores of the survey (75.36 percent), or above the average, were found in East Nusa Tenggara, Bali and Maluku. Meanwhile, the lowest score was found in Aceh. The survey also found correlation between occupations, active roles in organizations, and education and tolerance.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Abdul, the higher the education of tolerance, cooperation and equality, the higher the harmony will be. Therefore, education is necessary to develop multiculturalism horizon of students. All stakeholders, including the majority, should wisely accept differences. Education plays significant roles in promoting one's tolerance attitudes. The higher his/her education, the broader his/her horizons will be. Education on tolerance is important to avoid intolerance behaviors and violence.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> A research conducted by the Ministry to college students found that educational environment has direct impacts on religious tolerance, meaning that positive educational environment can grow tolerance in college students and lecturers. On the contrary, religious education results have the least impacts, compared to other factors. Ahmad Suaedy of Abdurrahman Wahid Center at University of Indonesia quoted the research conducted by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and said that religious schools tend to make students intolerance in their thought, suspicious of other religions, and reluctant to accept neighbors of other religions. Those can be due to exclusiveness of education, and distance between realities in social life and classroom.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> He added that religious education, sociology, and other sciences taught in schools have been uprooted from what exist in the environment. In fact, many traditions, religious teaching and tolerance values which have been local wisdoms will allow students to have sufficient understanding on the meaning of tolerance.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Kompas, Page 11</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar26-20.jpeg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","15 Sept 2016 In-school and out-of-school education plays significant roles in strengthening individual's awareness of tolerance amid diversity.

All parties in this country should take part in overcoming this issue. One of the successful districts that has launched a literacy program is Sidrap District of South Sulawesi. Many schools in the district have successfully implemented the program, one of which is SDN 1 Allakuang. The school principal, Muhammad Basri, shared his experience on how to nurture the students' reading interest. He said, ""We implement 15-minute reading every day and students may choose any book they like to read in a reading corner. If within 15 minutes, they haven't finished reading it, they may take it home."" That way, the students could read 12 books on average in a month.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Every Saturday, the school conducts a special activity to read for one hour. Students are given an opportunity to write and tell the story of the respective book they read. They usually take turn to share stories in 'achievement' stage. The school also gives a certificate to students who are good at story telling/content sharing. At the end of semester, the school would grant an award to the most active story teller. Basri revealed that in the last semester, Aisyah the student of Grade V won the competition after reading 130 books in 6 months.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> To cultivate students' reading interest, Basri added that what most important is providing and renewing books possibly using BOS Fund, contacting school alumni to contribute reading books to school, using general allocation fund of APBD, inviting mobile libraries twice in a month, exchanging reading books collection among supporting society on weekly basis, and cooperate with surrounding schools to do book exchange. This way, it is hoped that they are be able to maintain the student's reading interest.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Nur Kana'ah, Head of Education Office of Sidrap District also mentioned that many schools in Sidrap have successfully boosted students' reading interest. Sidrap District has implemented school literacy movement (GLS) since October 2015 started by forming a GLS team at district and sub district level. Nur explained that schools in Sidrap were given training and assistance by USAID PRIORITAS so that the program could run successfully and even made the district as the best and awarded Pioneer District in Literacy Movement among others in South Sulawesi on last April 2016.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The program has been widely supported by many parties, one of which is by Dandim 1420 that provided 7 units of reading motorcycle. These reading motorcycles provide some interesting reading books in remote and isolated school areas beyond the reach of Mobile Library Cars.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The success of Sidrap District has also been acknowledged by Dr. Supriano, Director of Junior Secondary School Development t MoEC. Supriano said, ""I appreciate the success of reading program in Sidrap. The 15-minute reading program has clearly increased primary school students' reading interest as the foundation of reading skills development which should be owned since the primary school.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, Hanna Chaterine George, Chairperson of the Indonesian Association of School Information Workers emphasized on the importance of empowerment to school librarians and to equip them with required skill. If not, the school library cannot be developed as expected. Librarians should be creative in encouraging students' reading interest, by offering interesting programs that would make students enjoy reading.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sulasmo Sudharno, the founder of iJakarta, the first social media based digital library presented the importance of utilizing digital library which is now easily accessible.

Many schools in the district have successfully implemented the program, one of which is SDN 1 Allakuang. The school principal, Muhammad Basri, shared his experience on how to nurture the students' reading interest. He said, ""We implement 15-minute reading every day and students may choose any book they like to read in a reading corner.

Other than that, M. Basri the Principal of SDN 1 Allakuang as one School Partner of USAID PRIORITAS, and Sulastomo Sudharno the founder of iJakarta, the first social media-based digital library.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> As a developing country, Indonesia has not yet shown good performance in literacy skill at an international level test. International study reported that Indonesia is one of 12 countries with significantly low scores in Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS). In addition, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) revealed that Indonesian students are lagging three years behind the average reading abilities of students in countries joined in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Indonesia is even ranked 60th out of 61 countries based on its literacy level, as mentioned by Connecticut State University USA in 2016.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Concerning this, Dr. Supriano, M.Ed said that the willingness to improve reading interest in Indonesia has been indicated already. Hanna Catherina, in the same occasion mentioned the reading interest in Indonesia varies in which the children prefer to read books in a bookstore, not in a library. According to Sulasmo, iJakarta has 5,000 books borrowed every day with varied traffic. The ways of reading have now changed as other people can access what we are reading.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Muhammad Basri indicated that Indonesian Children are merely reading, but not taught how to read independently, read together or even guided to read that may improve their motivation to read. Nur Kana'ah added that in Sidrap, the 15-minute reading program before the class starts has been maintained with the support of various parties. Stakeholders in Sidrap are given training to socialize the program. Official cars are branded as program promotion as well. For areas that are inaccessible by mobile library cars, Dandim has provided support in the form of reading motorcycles. This program is being socialized every day to become an example for other regions in improving reading interest.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Dealing with changes in library management, Supriano revealed that out of 213 million schools in Indonesia, 74 million of them do not have libraries. To manage this, currently referral schools are developed in 514 districts/cities with computer labs and internet facilities. Hanna Catherina emphasized on two contexts that need to be developed; firstly, librarian, who also serves as a teacher is required to create program to attract students to read books, secondly, the program should vary depending on the students' interest. Parents will also play great role at home. In primary school, printed books give more advantages, while in Junior and Senior High School, technology use for reading will present better function and appropriate to meet the needs of the children at their age.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sulasmo said iJakarta offers a solution towards the fact of low reading interest amidst of increasing interest in social media. Many parents forbid children to use gadget considering its negative impact on them, while in fact many benefits could be gained, including the internet, should they properly educated first. What's happening now is that there is a change in the way people read, because there is a lack of content, where digitization is merely converting existing book into digital form, and there is less interesting payment gateway and application. iJakarta offers a different program, because their users could borrow books, write, publish, give donation and create e-library. Above of all, iJakarta could be used for teaching and learning process as well.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Totok Suprayitno, Head of Research and Development Agency in MoEC, in his closing speech showed his appreciation for the good efforts shown by each party to nurture reading interest in Indonesia. In the future, libraries in Indonesia is hoped to not only be represented as buildings and books, but also program and structure that attracts children to visit them and do more than only read, but other activities such as book review, storytelling, drama show and etc.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> https://readingsocially.com/2016/10/12/membangun-budaya-baca-dan-mengantisipasi-perubahan-manajemen-perpustakaan/</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar27-41.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","12 Oct 2016 Expert Discussion and Opinion Sharing (Kopi Darat) carrying the theme """"Nurturing Reading Habit and Improving Library management"""" that was ","","","","10/12/2016 00:00:00","65","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:19","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

Additional speakers were M.

Children who could not develop literacy skill since early grade might not comprehend printed information, follow instruction and communicate in written form.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Indonesia has actually achieved high target of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on national literacy among youth aged 15-24 in 1990 and has reached almost 100% of the target group in 2015, except for Papua Province with only 87.2% teenagers proven to be educated. Gender mainstreaming has also been achieved in most of the regions in Indonesia. However, Indonesia could not yet perform better in international literacy. Indonesia, including 11 other countries, has a low rate in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS). In addition to this, more than 50% of children aged 15 in Indonesia do not master basic skills in reading or maths. In 2016, based on a study by Connecticut State University United States, Indonesia was still ranked lower than other countries.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The session also discussed the importance of teacher's role in learning, as such, teachers should be trained to improve phonemic awareness, phonic, fluency, skills in text comprehension, love of books and reading activity. The future and trends of books, including future library, require the government to establish a 'special' system to share information and research on science and technology topics. For example, Indonesia Center for Agriculture Library and Technology Dissemination (PUSTAKA) in Bogor has specified itself to share information in agriculture and biology for researcher, academics, farmer and other stakeholders.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://setjen.kemdikbud.go.id</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar27-45.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","12 Oct 2016 Expert Discussion and Opinion Sharing (Kopi Darat) that carried the theme """"Nurturing Reading Habit and Improving Library Management"""" was h","","","","10/12/2016 00:00:00","60","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:19","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

He could encourage students to read 12 books on average in a month through the 15-minute reading program before class starts.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Every Saturday, the school conducts a special activity of book reading for one hour. The students are given an opportunity to write and telling story a book. They usually take a turn to share it at the 'achievement' stage led by the school.

Supriano said, ""I appreciate the success of reading program in Sidrap. The 15-minutes of reading has increased students reading interest in primary school, as we all understand that the foundation for reading should be established appropriately since primary school.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, Hanna Chaterine George, Chairperson of the Indonesian Association of School Information Workers emphasized the importance of school librarian empowerment to have required skill. If not, the school library could not be developed. Librarians should be creative in encouraging students' reading interest by offering interesting programs that would make students enjoy reading.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sulasmo Sudharno, the founder of iJakarta, the first social media-based digital library presented the importance of utilizing digital library which is now easily accessible. A school could make its own library in iJakarta. This digital library is an open library where visitors could borrow books free of charge, read, write, publish and make their own e-library. Everyone is welcome. It would be interesting when students write, and then their writing pieces are collected and published as a book, and uploaded in a school library under iJakarta. This way, less money would be spent as there is no printing and distribution costs; just upload and many readers will access them.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://beritasore.com/2016/10/14/siswa-baca-minimal-12-buku-perbulan/</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar27-68.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","14 Oct 2016 The principal of SDN 1 Allakuang, Sidrap District as partner school of USAID PRIORITAS, Muhammad Basri, shared his experience on how to nu","","","","10/14/2016 00:00:00","62","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:19","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

However, Eko Cahyono the team member of the study mentioned in MoEC RI Jakarta on Wednesday 7 December 2016 that teachers play an important role to improve quality education.

However, based on studies by the Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) in the region of Sumba, the reading ability of grade II SD learners in the region is still low; it could even still be found in upper grade students. ACDP Study Team member, Eko Cahyono said that the teacher plays an important role in improving the students' literacy skills. In Sumba, the teachers explain the materials in Indonesian. However, the students themselves do not understand and could understand better the mother tongue language.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Vice Regent of East Sumba Regency, Umbu Lili Djangga in ACDP discussions in MoEC, Jakarta, Wednesday (07/12/2016), said that the circumstances described is real and the graduation rate in Sumba is low because literacy is not yet a priority.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Umbu explained that ideally grade II students could already read. But, what happens in Sumba is that students can pass grades although they still cannot read fluently. It had to be done because they stayed in the same class for too long. There are also grade VI students who still cannot read fluently. As a result, their national exams/ UN scores are low.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> He added that the low literacy skill is also due to the senior teachers who prefer teaching in the upper grade classes. While the lower grade classes are being handed to the intern teachers or the relatively new teachers.

However, based on studies by the Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) in the region of Sumba, the reading ability of grade II SD learners in the region is still low; it could even still be found in upper grade students.

The distribution will expectedly boost the even quality of education. Vice Regent of East Sumba, Umbu Lili Pekuwali in Jakarta on Wednesday (7/12) revealed that most teachers are just senior secondary school graduates while in terms of competence the primary school teachers are supposed to have bachelor degree qualification. This is the indication that the teachers are not yet well distributed since they are mainly placed in the city.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The study conducted by Education Sector Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) Indonesia revealed that the students repeated grade II primary school ranging from 19 to 21% in Sumba District and 30% of them have difficulty in reading. Civil Servant Teachers (PNS) are also not well distributed as shown that 60 % of teachers are non-civil servant. Approximately 42% of school principal is only senior secondary school graduates.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Dealing with this, Sumba District government formed a Forum of Sumba Education Care (FPPS) intended to play a role in supporting the policy concerning the education. Yohanis Umbu Djangga, Head of Education, Youth and Sport Office in Central Sumba District hoped that regulation in teacher distribution would improve the quality of education. Teachers should obey the rule and, if not, sanction will be imposed by discussing first the reason. If reasonable, we will accept it but if not, there will be sanction imposed for them.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In the same occasion, Head Bureau of Planning and Foreign Cooperation MoEC Luluk Budiono added that every region should pay attention to education and teacher competence.

One of the results published, is that as much as 30 percent of students in grade II Primary School (SD) have difficulty in reading. ACDP 040 Study Team Member of ACDP Indonesia, Eko Cahyono explained that the analysis underlines the high number of repeated grades in grade II, namely ranging between 12 to 21 percent in all regencies. In addition, approximately 30 percent of students in grade II SD have difficulty in reading.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Eko said that the high rate of repeat grades and low reading skills indicates the education quality in the early grades in Sumba. He proposed a test to determine the level of grade II and III in order to measure the learning readiness of each child. Eko explained in detail of a number of problems found in Sumba such as the proportion of teachers who are untrained, the availability and distribution of civil servant teachers (PNS), the availability of sustainable resources for private schools in Sumba, as well as the teaching quality of teachers and readiness of students to learn.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Eko, the teachers and educational personnel have also become a major problem in the Sumba education system. This is because teachers with bachelor degree (S1) qualifications or teachers with civil servant status are not evenly distributed on the island. The data refers to the number of schools being used as a case study in this research. The results showed that two-thirds of teachers in Sumba are only high school graduates.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The same could be found for the position of school principal.

In addition, Eko continued that as much as 60 percent of teachers who work in Sumba are not civil servant employees (PNS) and do not have the required qualifications.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Despite having problems with language, he said that nearly 75 percent of the students could answer questions verbally using their mother tongue.

Data released in PODES showed that 60% of villagers are categorized poor and 13% of the villages are called remote. This brings the impact to low quality education provided for the people. This condition was revealed during education discussion with experts called Kopi Darat on Wednesday (7/12) in Library of MoEC Jakarta with ACDP team.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The study entitled ""Strategy to Improve Effectiveness of Primary Education/Madrasah in Sumba, NTT"" was conducted by ACDP in cooperation with NTT Provincial government concerning education performance in NTT, especially in Sumba. This study revealed the high number of repeated grades in grade II, namely ranging between 12 to 21 percent in all districts. In addition, approximately 30 percent of students in grade II SD have difficulty in reading. This evidence indicated that quality of education in early grades Sumba is low and therefore a test is required for grade 2 or 3 students to find out whether the students have a sufficient basic and prepared for learning.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The teachers and educational personnel have also become a major problem in the Sumba education system. Two-thirds of teachers in Sumba are only high school graduates. The same could be found for the position of school principal. As many as 42 percent of the school principals in Sumba are high school graduates. In addition, the data showed that as much as 60 percent of teachers who work in Sumba are not civil servant employees (PNS) and do not have the required qualifications. Despite the above circumstances, the data showed a positive finding where the students could understand the learning material when teacher uses students' mother tongue language. The students to 75% could answer questions correctly for more than 50% of the questions given verbally as a part of comprehension test. The society also showed a very high awareness on the importance of Early Childhood Education (PAUD).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> To respond for the result of the study, all of the districts including Sumba District made a significant effort by designing a policy in three areas of priorities by making continuous professional development for early grades teachers especially in teaching literacy through KKG, Teachers Working Group. The second priority is to distribute quality teachers fairly to underdeveloped schools and the last priority is to reform the process of school principal promotion. In this case, Sumba has practices Knowledge-to-Policy through the formation of Forum of Sumba Education Care (FPPS) intended to encourage the formulation of policy on education in Sumba. This forum is potential for solving the issues of education especially on SD/MI. In addition, Sumba has also specific mechanism to do a study and prepare a policy. The district has the capacity to negotiate position of the policy with central government. This model will be promising for underdeveloped and remote district and in villages. The improvement of human resources and implementation of the adopted policy requires systemic capacity and strong political commitment.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://www.intipesan.com/2016/12/09/meningkatkan-potensi-sdm-sumba-melalui-pendidikan-dengan-bahasa-ibu/</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar29-15.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","9 Dec 2016 As one of the regions with average index lower than the national standard, Sumba has human resources quality far behind other regions.

The results of the mapping are considered not utilized to encourage regional administrations to work hard to improve the quality of education in their areas. Board of Trustees of Educational Policy Studies Center Nejeela Shihab said the role of central government and regional administrations needs to be reassessed. Thus, each party could actually run the obligation to meet the people's right to quality education. The education budget from the center and the regions should be ascertained to meet the needs in order to create a good educational ecosystem.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Najeela, based on the study of Local Education Index (NPD) towards the 2015 regional budget (APBD) by the Ministry of Education and Culture, it is apparent the commitment of regional administrations towards education has not materialized. The allocation of funds for education of at least 20 percent as mandated by the constitution is not met by the regional administrations. The 20 percent budget claim turned out to rely on regional allocation funds from the central government. Its use has not been able to boost the performance of education in the regions.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Education practitioner Aulia Wijiasih said there are not many regions that focus on improving the capacity of education stakeholders, ranging from school principals, supervisors, teachers, to the community. In addition, few regional administrations implement in earnest quality education services. Education funds are easiest spent on equipment and infrastructure. However, access to funding is limited to certain schools. This could happen because not many officials know very well the problems of education in their areas.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In discussion with experts on education called Kopi Darat held by Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP), it was revealed, the diversity of the regions and the commitment of the regional administrations have triggered the education gap. In a discussion on the situation of education in Sumba, East Nusa Tenggara, the study found that the weakness experienced by students at lower grades (I-III SD), is especially in reading. The problem is faced by students who are in remote areas or in schools that are far from adequate.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Eko Cahyono, ACDP study team member said, some lower-grade students in Sumba have poor literacy skills. Students are not proficient in reading because they are generally taught by teachers who are senior secondary school graduates. Students have learning difficulties also because generally they are only fluent in the mother tongue, but were 'forced' to learn in Indonesian.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Harian Kompas, Page 11</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar29-16.jpeg","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","10 Dec 2016 Follow up of mapping of the quality of education that is claimed by the central government to be carried out through national exams (UN) i","","","","12/10/2016 00:00:00","60","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:19","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

He encourages students to read 12 books on average in a month through a 15-minute reading program before class starts. He said that students may choose any book they like to read from the reading corner. If within 15 minutes, they have not finished reading it, they may take it home."" That way, students could read 12 books on average in a month.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Every Saturday, the school conducts a special activity to read for one hour. The students are given an opportunity to write and retell the content of a book. They usually take turn to share on an achievement stage that is provided by the school. The school also gives a certificate to students, who are good at retelling stories. At the end of semester, the school gives an award to the most frequent book reteller. Basri revealed that last semester, Aisyah Grade V student won the competition after reading 130 books in 6 months.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> To cultivate students reading interest, Basri added that what is most important is providing and renewing reading books possibly done by buying new books with BOS Fund, contacting the alumni to contribute reading books to school, using general allocation fund of APBD, inviting mobile libraries twice in a month, exchanging reading books collection among the reading corners weekly, and cooperating nearby schools to exchange books. This way it is hoped that they are able to maintain the student's reading interest.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Nur Kana'ah, Head of Education Office of Sidrap District also mentioned many schools in Sidrap have successfully boosted students reading interest. Sidrap District has implemented school literacy movement (GLS) since October 2015 starting by forming a GLS team in district and sub district level. Nur explained that the schools in Sidrap were given training and assistance by USAID PRIORITAS so that the program could run successfully and even made the district as the best and awarded Pioneer District in Literacy Movement among others in South Sulawesi on the last April 2016.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The program has been widely supported by many parties, one of which is by Dandim 1420 that provided 7 units of reading motorcycle.

If not, the school library could not be developed. The librarian should be creative in encouraging students' reading interest by offering interesting programs that would make students enjoy reading.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Sulasmo Sudharno, the founder of iJakarta, the first social media based digital library presented the importance of utilizing digital library which is now easily accessible. A school could make its own library in iJakarta. This digital library is an open library where visitors could borrow books free of charge, read, write, publish and make their own e-library. Everyone is welcome. It would be interesting when students write, and then the works are collected and published in a book, uploaded in a school library under iJakarta. This way less money would be spent as there is no printing and distribution fees; just upload and many readers will access it.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Harian Haluan, Page 11</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar28-11.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","13 Oct 2016 The principal of SDN 1 Allakuang, Sidrap District as partner school of USAID PRIORITAS, Muhammad Basri shared his experience on how to nur","","","","10/13/2016 00:00:00","66","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:19","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

The ICT changes how one works, socializes and communicates as well as practices of classroom learning.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> However, the Acting Head of Center of Curriculum and Textbooks, the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC), Nizam revealed that education in the villages is not yet called the prerequisite for information technology-based education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> He explained that ICT could potentially reduce gap by improving access to education and learning sources. The students in the villages are still left behind in these matters due to unsporting infrastructure. Telecommunication infrastructure remains the major challenge for the remote location with no access or little access to phone and internet services.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ACDP study in 2015 showed only approximately 30% of regions in Papua provided with electricity. Around 78% of primary school and 8% of secondary school took the source of electricity on diesel generator used in the night. Related to this, Nizam expected that the Palapa Ring, East Optic could improve telecommunication services in particular regions in Papua. ""Telecommunication in the box"" is also hoped to be an innovative solution that integrates and provides required infrastructure to supply service for cable telephone (fix-phone), cellular/mobile telephone, dial up and DSL internet access.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Another challenge in Papua and other remote regions is the limited hardware and software of ICT available. In Papua, for example, most schools have less than 5 computers and 50% of them only have 1 to 2 computers. Even though, ICT subject is obligatory, students do not use computer at schools. Only 20% of them use computer at least once a week and 73% of then has no internet access at schools. TV-Education providing lesson via television appeared to be used more by students as reflected in 30-40% of respondents, mostly when their teachers are not present.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Whereas, Nizam expressed the question and worries about the future of such TV-based material in the era of internet and online teaching material today.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> http://www.mirajnews.com/id/pendidikan-di-desa-masih-tertinggal-dari-sisi-digital/137345</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar28-18.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","10 Nov 2016 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been integrated to almost all aspects of modern life.

The results showed that only 30% of schools are provided with electric power in Papua, so the use of ICT in schools could not be optimum. The device is made available, but trainings or adequate learnings are not prepared.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Totok said, the survey was conducted upon 112 school principals and 1,500 teachers, which found almost more than 50% of school principals do not use the Internet. In fact, among teachers, 68% of them do not understand and do not use electronic mail (e-mail). When actually, ICT is integrated in almost all aspects in modern life. ICT changes how people work, socialize and communicate, including affecting the learning process in the classroom. According to Totok, such situation is very alarming, because in the era of technology, it would be very difficult for teachers to communicate with colleagues from other regions without the use of e-mail.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ICT expert Onno W Purbo also expressed a similar opinion. He said, the government must continue to make ICT as a lesson/subject. Both ICT in every lesson, as well as ICT as a subject. Teachers with low readiness in ICT are one of the obstacles to the advancement of education. Onno also questioned whether the Teacher and Education Personnel Training Institute (LPTK) teaches ICT for respective subjects. If not, then we will see the same poor quality of teacher in years ahead.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Meanwhile, Head of Center of Education Assessment, the Ministry of Education and Culture, Prof. Nizam said the journey of ICT in education is quite long, starting from the disparity of access. The essence of 21st century skills is processing information into knowledge/science, and making it a competence to solve problems. He explained, things that need to be built/developed are not merely how to use technological tools but also how to optimize them for learning values such as good attitude to build the child's empathy.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Suara Pembaruan, Page 17</p>","","","","","","","","images/thumb/thumb_pt_en/kopdar28-22.png","","images/thumb/thumb_lc_en/newsarticle_acdp_lc.jpg","","","","","ACDP Indonesia","","","","11 Nov 2016 Consultant of Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) Indonesia Totok Soefijanto Amin said, in 2015 ACDP conducted a study ","","","","11/10/2016 00:00:00","61","1","0","1","0","1","","6/15/2017 14:20:19","0/0/0000 00:00:00"

Teachers could use social media to deliver or teach material to students. The student would also be assisted in finding educational material faster. To that end, ICT development requires more active teachers to learn the knowledge and skills of computer and internet.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> However, the ICT development in Indonesia is still inhibited by varied factors such as low ICT knowledge, geographical challenge and lack of supporting infrastructure for ICT learning. To solve these challenges, UNESCO and ACDP team in Indonesia have developed ICT Competency Framework for teachers. This is mainly aimed to prove the ability of the students to learn and adapt to ICT gradually. This framework is then adapted by MoEC and included into Ministerial Regulation No.16 of 207 about Teacher Competency. Three stages of teaching ICT skills to students are applied as below:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Technology literacy: teaching students to use ICT efficiently;</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Knowledge exploration: building students ICT skill and assisting them to use it; to apply and to use in daily cases.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Knowledge creation: empowering students to create new knowledge by using ICT, to participate in building society welfare as a citizen or as an employee.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Teacher could use ICT to build network and create various learning sources, develop practical cooperation among teachers in both regional and global level. In addition, teacher training should not only enable the teachers to be competent but also to train them to be proficient in using alternate pedagogical approaches intending specially to produce creative, skillful students in solving the problems and collaborative students to adapt with modern world.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Teacher training institution, therefore, needs to prepare a professional ICT learning and pedagogical skill integrated in the curriculum.

Islamic education consists of approximately 2,999 Raudhatul Athfal; 24,560 Madrasah Ibtidaiyah; 16,934 Madrasah Tsanawiyah; 7,843 Madrasah Aliyah; 699 Islamic Study Colleges; 28,961 Pondok Pesantrens (*); 76,566 Madrasah Diniyah Takmiliyah (*); 134,860 Qur'anic Kindergartens/ Qur'anic Playgroups/Ta'limul Qur'an lil Aulad (TKQ/TPQ/TQA) (*), 30 Formal Diniyahs and 48 Muadalahs.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""We are currently guiding around 318,500 Islamic education institutions and not less than 42 million students of Islamic religious education. As a sub sector of national education, Islamic Education is providing educational services to at least 66.6 million students all over the country, and it is becoming the most significant contributor in regards to total participants of education nationally"", explained the Director General of Islamic Education, Prof. Dr. Phil. H. Kamaruddin Amin, M.A.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The Minister of Religious Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, H. Lukman Hakim Saifuddin, gave a speech emphasizing the great potential of Indonesia's Islamic Education in realizing excellence in teaching moderate Islamic Education. Islamic education in Indonesia could become a world reference in integrating religious subjects, science, other forms of knowledge and technology. He also reiterated that ""to ensure the quality of human resources, Islamic Education should focus on at least three aspects including the quality of education, building the virtuous and noble character of students, and students' development of higher order thinking skills.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Head of Research and Development Agency, Ministry of Education and Culture, Ir. Totok Suprayitno, Ph.D, , also attended the event and expressed his appreciation for the innovations made by the Ministry of Religious Affairs.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Totok mentioned that, ""Islamic Education has filled the gap in services of education for the children in remote, isolated, outer, and underdeveloped regions. Without the support of Islamic Education, Compulsory 12 Years Education could not be achieved.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The Values and Culture of Peace in Senior Secondary Islamic Religious Education</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In 2013, the Directorate General of Islamic Education received the grant from ACDP in the form of a study on Islamic Religious Education at Secondary Schools. The purpose was to explore the issue of radicalism in schools, to find out how it enters the school and ways to prevent it.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The results of this study strengthen those of previous studies and reveal that radicalism has entered several secondary schools. Ways in which this has tended to occur include directly, through students' participation in radical mass organizations in the community, and indirectly, through activists who activelyintervene in the extracurricular programs of Islamic Religious Education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Furthermore, this study revealed that Islamic religion has been the least popular subject amongst students due to the tendency for it to be delivered in a dogmatic and conventional way, which tends to makes the subject matter boring.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In fact, in addition to presenting normative theology, Islamic Religious Education curriculum can foster the culture and values of peace such as al-taaruf (synergy), al-shura (discussion and consensus), al-taawun (cooperation), al-amanah (trust), husnudzan (free of prejudice), al-takaful (sharing burden with others), al-salam (peace) and al-afwu (forgiveness). These values may be developed to cope with radicalism.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Based on its findings, the study recommended reforming Islamic religious teaching so that it is designed not only to strengthen the faith through daily religious practices but also to instill the values and culture of peace as the instrument for character building. Such reform is ultimately aimed at supporting the effort to neutralize and avoid the entry of radicalism into schools.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The reform covers both the curriculum (the content of the teaching material enriched with the culture and values of peace) and teachers (who lead the reform in pedagogy approach). Teachers will need to shift from teaching doctrine to leading experiential-based learning to develop students' critical thinking and problem solving skills.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In addition, adjusting extracurricular programs will be also be needed by empowering ROHIS facilitators and also providing guidance for ROHIS committees. ROHIS can play a role in fostering the values and culture of peace.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The Directorate of Islamic Religious Teaching, supported by ACDP, adopted the above recommendations among others through the Training of Trainers (ToT), which took place at the University of Oxford in England. The ToT included 30 prospective national trainers, who prepared the design and module for training teachers in the Islam rahmatan lil 'alamin (ISRA) based learning method. This method integrates new learning methods with education in the values and culture of peace and tolerance within the Islamic Religious Subject content.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Along with the national trainers and the training handbook, the training of Indonesian Islamic religious teachers in the Islam rahmatan lil 'alamin based learning method has been conducted through MGMP and provincial and district training. Indonesian school teachers have also been trained in foreign countries that are vulnerable to the influence of radicalism.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The Directorate of Islamic Religious Education has also conducted an annual gathering of ROHIS. The gathering was attended by 1,800 students of SMA/SMK and 200 ROHIS facilitators, who used a guide book to discuss ISRA based learning methods in extracurricular activities.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""These activities are expectedly able to be strategic instruments in avoiding the entry of radicalism, the potential of which has recently been identified in approximately 30% of public secondary school students"", said Kamaruddin.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The launch of the study by the Directorate General of Islamic Education of the Ministry of Religious Affairs and ACDP was also attended by several ambassadors of foreign countries as well as delegates of Ministries and Work Cabinets, echelon I and II officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the Head Regional Office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, development partner delegates, delegates from civil society organizations and members of the national press.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The event closed with an exhibition of numerous educational institutions under the Directorate General of Islamic Education of the Ministry of religious Affairs.

The studies are on Madrasah Education Financing in Indonesia; Study on Islamic Religious Education in Secondary Schools in Indonesia; the Values and Culture of Peace in Islamic Education Curriculum for Secondary School (Guide Book for Teachers) in Indonesian; a Technical Guide for Islam Rahmatan Lil'Alamin Based Learning in Islamic and Character Education in Indonesian, which consists of a Training Design, Training Module and Learning Method Module; and an Overview of Islamic Education Sub-sector in Indonesia 2014.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The results of these studies have served as a reference for the government in creating strategies and plans (RPJMN and Strategic Plan), and in formulating Islamic Education policy generally. The studies have also been used to support the improvement of Islamic Religious Teachers' competencies, especially those related to the Islam rahmatan lil 'alamin based Learning Method (ISRA), which is used in public schools.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Release from ACDP mentions, Islamic education consists of approximately 2,999 Raudhatul Athfal; 24,560 Madrasah Ibtidaiyah; 16,934 Madrasah Tsanawiyah; 7,843 Madrasah Aliyah; 699 Islamic Study Colleges; 28,961 Pondok Pesantrens (*); 76,566 Madrasah Diniyah Takmiliyah (*); 134,860 Qur'anic Kindergartens/ Qur'anic Playgroups/Ta'limul Qur'an lil Aulad(TKQ/TPQ/TQA) (*), 30 Formal Diniyahs and 48 Muadalahs.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""We are currently guiding around 318,500 Islamic education institutions and not less than 42 million students of Islamic religious education"", the Director General of Islamic Education, H. Kamaruddin Amin explained. As a sub sector of national education, Islamic Education is providing educational services to at least 66.6 million students all over the country, and it is becoming the most significant contributor in regards to total participants of education nationally.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>Reference for the World</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The Minister of Religious Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, H. Lukman Hakim Saifuddin, gave a speech emphasizing the great potential of Indonesia's Islamic Education in realizing excellence in teaching moderate Islamic Education. Islamic education in Indonesia could become a world reference in integrating religious subjects, science, other forms of knowledge and technology. He also reiterated that ""to ensure the quality of human resources, Islamic Education should focus on at least three aspects including the quality of education, building the virtuous and noble character of students, and students' development of higher order thinking skills."" The three objectives stated above are meant to turn Indonesia's golden generation into resilient women and men, who are capable of facing global competition and responding to new and greater challenges.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Head of Research and Development Agency, Ministry of Education and Culture, Ir. Totok Suprayitno, Ph.D, , also attended the event and expressed his appreciation for the innovations made by the Ministry of Religious Affairs. ""Without the support of Islamic Education, Compulsory 12 Years Education could not be achieved"", he mentioned. Furthermore, Totok commented on the strength of the coverage of Madrasah, which has provided public Islamic education to approximately 20% of school aged children. Thanks to the Formal Diniyah Schools, Islamic Education, which was formerly considered non-formal education, is now considered equal to other forms of public education. ""I also support the Minister of Religious Affairs who is fully aware that character education, literacy skills, and other competencies will be required skills for Indonesian Children in the 21st Century"", said Totok.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>The Values and Culture of Peace</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In 2013, the Directorate General of Islamic Education received the grant from ACDP in the form of a study on Islamic Religious Education at Secondary Schools. The purpose was to explore the issue of radicalism in schools, to find out how it enters the school and ways to prevent it.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The results of this study strengthen those of previous studies and reveal that radicalism has entered several secondary schools. Ways in which this has tended to occur include directly, through students' participation in radical mass organizations in the community, and indirectly, through activists who activelyintervene in the extracurricular programs of Islamic Religious Education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Other than the ways mentioned above, radicalism could potentially enter schools indirectly through mass media, particularly television, parents, communities, extracurricular organizations for university students, and extracurricular activities called Islamic Spirit Groups (ROHIS). Furthermore, this study revealed that Islamic religion has been the least popular subject amongst students due to the tendency for it to be delivered in a dogmatic and conventional way, which tends to makes the subject matter boring.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In fact, in addition to presenting normative theology, Islamic Religious Education curriculum can foster the culture and values of peace such as al-taaruf (synergy), al-shura (discussion and consensus), al-taawun (cooperation), al-amanah (trust), husnudzan (free of prejudice), al-takaful (sharing burden with others), al-salam (peace) and al-afwu (forgiveness). These values may be developed to cope with radicalism. Students still trust in and have high expectations of Islamic Religious Education, and they admit that Islamic Religious Teachers have a better understanding of right and moderate Islamic Religion than ROHIS facilitators.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>Reformation in Teaching</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Based on its findings, the study recommended reforming Islamic religious teaching so that it is designed not only to strengthen the faith through daily religious practices but also to instill the values and culture of peace as the instrument for character building. Such reform is ultimately aimed at supporting the effort to neutralize and avoid the entry of radicalism into schools. The reform covers both the curriculum (the content of the teaching material enriched with the culture and values of peace) and teachers (who lead the reform in pedagogy approach). Teachers will need to shift from teaching doctrine to leading experiential-based learning to develop students' critical thinking and problem solving skills.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In addition, adjusting extracurricular programs will be also be needed by empowering ROHIS facilitators and also providing guidance for ROHIS committees. ROHIS can play a role in fostering the values and culture of peace.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The Directorate of Islamic Religious Teaching, supported by ACDP, adopted the above recommendations among others through the Training of Trainers (ToT), which took place at the University of Oxford in England. The ToT included 30 prospective national trainers, who prepared the design and module for training teachers in the Islam rahmatan lil 'alamin (ISRA) based learning method. This method integrates new learning methods with education in the values and culture of peace and tolerance within the Islamic Religious Subject content.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>Teacher Training</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Along with the national trainers and the training handbook, the training of Indonesian Islamic religious teachers in the Islam rahmatan lil 'alamin based learning method has been conducted through MGMP and provincial and district training. Indonesian school teachers have also been trained in foreign countries that are vulnerable to the influence of radicalism.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The Directorate of Islamic Religious Education has also conducted an annual gathering of ROHIS. The gathering was attended by 1,800 students of SMA/SMK and 200 ROHIS facilitators, who used a guide book to discuss ISRA based learning methods in extracurricular activities.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> ""These activities are expectedly able to be strategic instruments in avoiding the entry of radicalism, the potential of which has recently been identified in approximately 30% of public secondary school students"", said Kamaruddin.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The launch of the study by the Directorate General of Islamic Education of the Ministry of Religious Affairs and ACDP was also attended by several ambassadors of foreign countries as well as delegates of Ministries and Work Cabinets, echelon I and II officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the Head Regional Office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, development partner delegates, delegates from civil society organizations and members of the national press.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> The event closed with an exhibition of numerous educational institutions under the Directorate General of Islamic Education of the Ministry of religious Affairs.

These are carried out to revise and improve quality of Islamic Education in our country. The Minister of Religious Affairs explained that Islamic education should focus on several aspects to fulfill the target of revision and improvement of quality. The focuses are namely the quality of education, the good character formation of students and noble character, as well as skills development.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In the speech concerning the result of studies on Islamic Education carried out by Directorate General of Islamic Education MoRA RI and Australia and European Union through Education Sector Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership, Lukman said that the result of studies include the study of finance for madrasah education in Indonesia, peace cultural values of education in Islamic education at secondary school, guiding book for teachers and package of technical guidance for Islam rahmatan lil'alamin based learning method and character education.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Lukman also suggested that the mechanism of Islamic education teaching is not dominated by monologue lecturing.

Thus, teachers should master the teaching methodology and deliver the material in such an attractive way.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> <strong>Improve Learning and Counteract Radicalism</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> According to Director General of Islamic Education MoRA RI Kamaruddin Amin, the result of studies on Islamic education is beneficial to improve learning method and counteract radicalism. The radicalism is predicted to influence 35 % of secondary school students. The content of material in curriculum is enriched by peace cultural values and teachers are encouraged to apply experience based learning, critical thinking, and problem solving skills, not dogmatic methods.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Islamic education has several methods to foster peace cultural values such concepts as al-taaruf (synergy), al-shura (discussion and consensus), al-taawun (cooperation), al-amanah (trust), huznudzan (good prejudice), al-takaful (sharing burdens with others), al-salam (peace) and al-afwu (forgiveness). Kamaruddin believed these values may be developed to counter radicalism.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> However, Kamaruddin said, professional Islamic Subject teachers is still limited in quantity. There are thousands school that do not have Islamic Subject Teachers and even many of them are not from linear education background. To deal with this problem, new Islamic subject teachers are promoted. Their quality is upgraded not only in term of material mastery but also in skills to encourage students actively involved and be productive. Then, the objective of Islam Rahmatan Lil'alamin based character can be achieved.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In the same occasion, Head of Research and Development Agency MoEC, Totok Suprayitno appreciated the innovation made on Islamic education teaching. Islamic education has been successfully filled out vacant services of education for children living in remote, isolated, frontier and disadvantaged regions.

Islamic education can fill the gap in the service of education with Islamic character for students in frontier areas.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> This was revealed by Totok referring to the power and reach of the madrasah that has provided services of general education with Islamic character in the remote, outermost and frontier areas (3T). Some 20% of children of school age have learned through Formal Diniyah. Previously, education on the Islamic religion was held informally. Currently, Islamic education has become formal and is equal to general education. Totok explained this matter at the event releasing the results of study discussion by Directorate General of Islamic Education and Education Sector Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP) as a reference in formulating a study with a theme of ""Improvement of the Quality of Islamic Education in Indonesia.""</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Totok hoped that Islamic education can contribute to the moral education in the future. In this case, it is related to the character of Indonesian nationalism to compete in this era of globalization.

Moreover, Islamic education in Indonesia has a future vision to realize excellent and moderate Islamic education as a reference for the world in the integration of religious knowledge, science and technology. The Minister also mentioned that he will keep improving Islamic learning.

According to Henny, education on contrary may strengthen group identity and intolerant attitude. Therefore, teachers should play a role to be the reference of diversity for the students. There should be a spirit to respect diversity in the society through the revision of education model at school. Interreligious education model can be the alternate to apply. The book of interreligious education for elementary school to higher education and public are prepared by Centre for Dialogue and Cooperation among Civilizations, Religions for Peace, and King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In this education model, religious education is carried out by combining kindness values of varied religions.

"870","National Teacher Workforce Mapping & Projections","","<p>This working paper views the teacher retirement pattern as an opportunity to improve the teacher management system and: address inequities in teacher distribution, gradually curb the burgeoning teacher wage bill, and move incrementally towards a sustainable teacher management system. Approximately 48% of civil service (PNS) teachers will reach the mandatory retirement age of 60 between 2017 and 2027, according to the MOEC and MORA administrative databases from January 2017. The wave of PNS teacher retirement is a onetime phenomenon that ofers opportunities to reform teacher management without encountering the widespread resistance met by past attempts. In particular, the retirement pattern can help: (i) improve equity of teacher distribution by transferring the vacant positions of retired PNS teachers to less advantaged schools or areas; (ii) reduce the teacher wage bill by not flling all PNS teacher vacancies; and/or (iii) transition to a sustainable teacher management model.</p>

Sekitar 48% guru pegawai negeri sipil (PNS) akan mencapai usia pensiun wajib 60 antara tahun 2017 dan 2027, berdasarkan database administrasi Kemendikbud dan Kemenag per Januari 2017. Gelombang guru PNS yang pensiun adalah fenomena yang memberikan kesempatan untuk reformasi pengelolaan guru tanpa menghadapi banyak penolakan. Secara khusus, pola pensiun dapat membantu: (i) meningkatkan pemerataan penyebaran guru dengan mentransfer posisi kosong yang ditinggalkan guru PNS pensiun ke sekolah-sekolah atau daerah tertinggal; (ii) mengurangi pengeluaran untuk guru dengan tidak mengisi semua lowongan guru PNS; dan / atau (iii) transisi ke model Pengelolaan Guru yang berkelanjutan.</p>

"871","Support to Sustainable Development Goals","","<p>As efforts to achieve the MDG targets, the Indonesian government has integrated the MDGs into National Long-Term Development Plan (RPJPN 2005-2025), National Medium Term Development Plan (RPJMN 2005-2009 and 2010-2014), the National Annual Development Plan (RKP), and the State Budget (APBN) Documents. Presidential Instruction No.3 Year 2010 stipulates priority objectives of equitable development in favor of the MDGs achievement. The Ministry of Planning / Bappenas has coordinated the preparation of the Roadmap of MDGs achievement and together with BAPPEDA has facilitated accelerating MDGs achievement through the preparation and implementation of the Regional Action Plan (RAD) MDGs in every province. This document aims to report MDGs implementation and achievement in Indonesia within a period of 15 years from 2000 to 2015. Reporting includes achievement of objectives, indicators and targets of each predetermined goal. In addition, the report also describes the undertaken efforts and lessons learned, as well as the unfinished agenda in achieving the MDG targets to be continued in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).&nbsp;The data used in this achievment report of 15 years MDGs in Indonesia is derived from the document and report of planning and implementation of development programs, report of evaluation and study of the program implementation and achievement, and various data of census, survey and registration of the development issue undertaken by various stakeholders, mainly from the Central Bureau of Statistics and related sectors.</p>
","<p>The Heads of State and representatives of 189 countries through the United Nations meeting in New York in 2000 had agreed on the Declaration of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to ensure the world public welfare. MDGs include eight goals: Goal 1: Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger; Goal 2: Achieve Universal Primary Educa on; Goal 3: Promote Gender Equality and Women Empowerment; Goal 4: Reduce Child Mortality; Goal 5: Improve Maternal Health; Goal 6: Combat HIV / AIDS, Malaria, and Other Communicable Diseases; Goal 7: Ensure Environmental Sustainability; and Goal 8: Develop a Global Partnership for Development. Each goal in the MDGs has been described into one or more targets and have measurable indicators of achievement. ACDP provided support in the development of a report for Indonesia&rsquo;s achievement of MDGs, including achievement results, efforts and lessons learned, unfinished agenda-s and issues post-MDG.</p>

<p>During MDGs implementation, following challenges were identified: provision of data at the district and the city level, reduction of achievement gap among districts and regions, mobilization of resources from community and business entities, and strengthening communication and advocacy strategy to various stakeholders. All these lessons and challenges provides a very valuable input to the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Indonesia. ACDP also further provided technical support to the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) to formulate the Technical Guidelines of the National Action Plan and the preparation of technical guidance of Operational Definition of each SDG indicator.</p>
","","Dukungan untuk Tujuan Pembangunan Berkelanjutan (SDGs)","","<p>Dalam upaya mencapai target Tujuan Pembangunan Millenium (MDGs), pemerintah Indonesia telah mengintegrasikan MDGs ke dalam Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Panjang Nasional (RPJPN 2005-2025), Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional (RPJMN&nbsp;2005-2009 dan 2010-2014), Rencana Kerja Pemerintah (RKP), dan Dokumen Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara (APBN). Instruksi Presiden No. 3 Tahun 2010 menetapkan tujuan prioritas pembangunan yang setara demi pencapaian MDGs. Kementerian Perencanaan / Bappenas telah mengkoordinasikan penyusunan roadmap pencapaian MDGs.&nbsp;Bersama dengan BAPPEDA, Bappenas telah memfasilitasi percepatan pencapaian MDGs melalui persiapan dan pelaksanaan Rencana Aksi Daerah (RAD) MDGs di setiap provinsi. Dokumen ini bertujuan untuk melaporkan implementasi dan pencapaian MDGs di Indonesia dalam kurun waktu 15 tahun dari tahun 2000 sampai 2015. Laporan mencakup pencapaian tujuan, indikator dan sasaran dari setiap sasaran yang telah ditentukan. Selain itu, laporan&nbsp;juga menggambarkan upaya dan pembelajaran yang dilakukan, serta agenda yang belum selesai dalam mencapai target MDGs untuk dilanjutkan di Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Data yang digunakan dalam laporan pencapaian 15 tahun MDGs di Indonesia ini berasal dari dokumen dan laporan perencanaan dan pelaksanaan program pembangunan, laporan evaluasi dan kajian pelaksanaan dan pencapaian program, dan berbagai data sensus, survei dan registrasi&nbsp;isu pembangunan yang dilakukan oleh berbagai pemangku kepentingan, terutama dari Biro Pusat Statistik dan sektor terkait.</p>
","<p>Kepala Negara dan perwakilan 189 negara melalui pertemuan Perserikatan&nbsp;Bangsa-Bangsa (PBB) di New York pada tahun 2000 telah menyetujui Deklarasi Tujuan Pembangunan Milenium (Millennium Development Goals / MDGs) untuk memastikan kesejahteraan masyarakat dunia. MDGs mencakup delapan tujuan: Tujuan 1: Memberantas Kemiskinan Ekstrim dan Kelaparan; Tujuan 2: Mencapai Pendidikan Dasar Universal; Tujuan 3: Mempromosikan Kesetaraan Gender dan Pemberdayaan Perempuan; Tujuan 4: Mengurangi Tingkat Kematian Anak; Tujuan 5: Memperbaiki Kesehatan Ibu; Tujuan 6: Memerangi HIV / AIDS, Malaria&nbsp;dan Penyakit Menular Lainnya; Tujuan 7: Memastikan Kelestarian Lingkungan; Dan Tujuan 8: Mengembangkan Kemitraan Global untuk Pembangunan. Setiap tujuan dalam MDGs telah dijadikan satu atau beberapa target dan memiliki indikator pencapaian yang terukur. ACDP memberikan dukungan dalam pengembangan laporan pencapaian MDGs di Indonesia, termasuk hasil pencapaian, upaya dan pelajaran yang dipetik, agenda dan isu yang belum selesai pasca MDG.</p>

<p>Selama pelaksanaan MDGs, tantangan berikut telah diidentifikasi: penyediaan data di tingkat kabupaten dan kota, pengurangan kesenjangan prestasi antar kabupaten dan kota, mobilisasi sumber daya dari masyarakat dan badan usaha, dan penguatan strategi komunikasi dan advokasi kepada berbagai pemangku kepentingan. Semua pelajaran dan tantangan ini memberikan masukan yang sangat berharga bagi pelaksanaan Tujuan Pembangunan Berkelanjutan (SDG) di Indonesia. ACDP juga memberikan bantuan teknis kepada Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional (Bappenas) untuk merumuskan Pedoman Teknis Rencana Aksi Nasional dan penyusunan panduan teknis Definisi Operasional masing-masing indikator SDG.</p>
