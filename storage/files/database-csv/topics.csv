"1","1","Primary and Secondary Education","<p dir=""ltr"">Indonesia divides basic education into two levels: primary school (six years) and junior secondary school (three years). This sub-sector also now includes non-formal education (out-of-school equivalency programs) through Package A (primary) and Package B (junior secondary). The two levels provided formal education by a combination of public and private schools under MoEC, and Islamic schools (Madrasah Ibtidaiyah/MI &amp; Madrasah Tsanawiyah/MTs), under the responsibility of Ministry of Religious Affairs.</p>

<p><a href=""/myadmin/upload/files/PP%2047%20Tahun%202008.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Government Regulation 47/2008</a> states that the government shall implement a compulsory free education policy, including primary and junior secondary education as well as non-formal education programs (Packages A&amp;B). The government has implemented several programs to increase the availability and affordability of education services, which function to establish new school units, rehabilitate classrooms, and develop one-roof (<em>satu atap</em>) schools. They also provide <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=27"" target=""_blank"">school operational assistance (BOS)</a>, scholarships&nbsp;for poor students, and other forms of support.</p>

<p>An issue apparent in Indonesia&#39;s basic education is <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=27"" target=""_blank"">school operational fund assistance (BOS)</a>. In 2005, the BOS scheme was introduced and it had the largest impact at school level across the country. The plan of BOS funds for school operational costs is the most significant policy initiative, which is valuable for schools in poorer, more remote areas that often lack of any operational budget. &nbsp;However, BOS has decreased community participation in education because of parents&rsquo; perception that BOS covers all costs. &nbsp;Also, parents are still asked to make other financial contributions for infrastructure, equipment, and extracurricular expenses.</p>

<p>Another issue has to do with MoEC and MoRA&rsquo;s strategic plan to combine primary and junior secondary school (one-roof). Despite the fact that this has been an important strategy for increasing equitable access, particularly in remote areas, it does not guarantee learning quality as teachers in many on-roof schools are primary school teachers. Since the refurbishment process has been self-managed by the schools, this program has helped to enhance school-based management, with the involvement of school committees and parents. By doing so, it has made a significant contribution to improving learning environments.</p>

<p>Issues also include access and enrollments. The leveling off of both net enrollment rate (NER)&nbsp;and gross enrollment rate (GER) is presumably due to the difficulty in providing access for all children, particularly those in <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=3"" target=""_blank"">remote areas</a>. There is also issue with transition rates, in which large numbers of children still do not continue their studies beyond primary level. Children drop out and they tend to come from families with lower socioeconomic status, 64.4% of children aged 7-12 years and 50% of aged 13-15 years. Another issue is teacher qualification and distribution, where teachers tend to prefer to be posted in urban rather than rural areas. To address this issue, the central government has decided to distribute teachers across provinces; provincial governments may distribute teachers across districts; and district governments may distribute teachers within their area. In reality, this decision is administratively difficult to implement etc. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=21"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>There are several senior secondary education (SSE) type of forms in Indonesia, such a formal, non-formal, and informal. Formal SSE is offered through of general senior secondary schools (SMA), <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=8"" target=""_blank"">vocational senior secondary schools (SMK)</a>, and <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=6"" target=""_blank"">Islamic senior secondary schools (Madrasah Aliyah/MA)</a>. Non-formal SSE consist of senior secondary Package C (Paket C), which is equivalent to SMA. This section concentrates mostly on SMA and MA, though reference is made to SMK in regard to gender equity.</p>

<p>SSE has expanded through private senior secondary schools that continued to dominate the sub-sector in terms of numbers of schools. For approximately 70% of senior secondary schools, privately run schools tend to have much lower enrollments than public schools.</p>

<p>The issues include, but are not limited to, public vs. private senior secondary education where public school system appears to be more efficient than the private school system; geographic inequalities&mdash;the regional divide may not be applicable in the case of SSE enrollments; gender inequality-- the ratio of females to males has actually declined over the past decade, which may be related to the fact that many of the courses offered in SMK are regarded to relate to male-dominated occupations and that SMA courses are seen as more appropriate for females; &nbsp;and inefficiency in senior secondary education in respect to dropout and repetition rates and to a low student/teacher ratio. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=22"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>After the government has considered this sub-sector a key strategy for economic development, enrollment in vocational education and training in Indonesia increased 158% between 2001 and 2010. However, this significant growth has tended to be supply-driven rather than demand-driven, which has created obstacles in ensuring that the skills of the graduates from vocational education and training are matched to the demands of the labor market. Vocational education and training is offered through both formal and non-formal services. Formal vocational education is the larger of the two sub-sectors and is offered at secondary levels through vocational senior secondary schools (SMK) and higher education levels through Diploma I, II, III, and IV programs including a 3-year program within polytechnics and academies (akademi) by both public and private institutions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Under all education-related laws, vocational education at the senior secondary and tertiary levels is mandated. Operationalized under the National Education Standards Board (BSNP), the <a href=""http://bsnp-indonesia.org/?page_id=61"" target=""_blank"">National Standards of Education (SNP)</a> set the standards for vocational education. The Directorate General (DG) of Senior Secondary Education (SSE) has the main responsibility for overseeing formal vocational education at the SSE&nbsp;level. The responsibility for vocational education at the tertiary level sits with the DG of Higher Education. Non-formal vocational training is the responsibility of the DG of Early Childhood Education, Non-formal Education, and Informal Education, which are within the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC). The new system introduced by Ministry of Education Decree 036/O/1997 has only one type of vocational secondary school (Sekolah Menengah Kejuruan or SMK) from previously six types. Within this system, an SMK may provide a wide range of vocational subjects rather than specializing in only a limited number of fields.</p>

<p>Some issues are: supply and demand--education should be conducted through a demand-based approach, as the supply-based vocational education fails to equip students with skills that fit industry demands. To assist with better planning and service provision, a routine demand analysis on human resource should be conducted to better serve the labor market; gender differences&mdash;the only significant difference in terms of gender and enrollment within the senior secondary education sub-sector is the level of female enrollment in vocational secondary schools; dropout rates--dropout rates fluctuated over the past decade. The higher dropout rate from SMK may be associated with socio-economic status as students tend to come from families with a lower economic status than their SMA counterparts, etc. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=23"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

Law 20/2003&rsquo;s aim is to include&nbsp;international standard units as strategy for improving quality. The International Standard Schools (ISS) law has been in debate these past few years and is currently under review by the Constitutional Court.</p>

<p>ISS qualification is that the school must meet the eight <a href=""http://bsnp-indonesia.org/?page_id=61"" target=""_blank"">National Education Standards (NES)</a>. The ISS general characteristics or requirements that are identified by <a href=""https://mudarwan.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/permendiknas_nomor_78_tahun_2009_tentang_penyelenggaraan_sbi.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Ministerial Regulation 78/2009</a> are: (i) using English as the medium of instruction in science, mathematics, and vocational subjects; (ii) adopting curricula and an accreditation standard from an <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/"" target=""_blank"">OECD</a> or other developed country; (iii) being accredited by a school in an OECD or other developed country; engaging and collaborating with an overseas &ldquo;sister school&rdquo; (iv) requiring teachers and principals to have S2 (masters) degrees (v) having fully equipped ICT facilities; etc.</p>

<p>Some issues include the fact that International School Stubs (RSBI) special training on management, administration, and monitoring and evaluation have not been received by the provincial and city/district staff who handle RSBI responsibilities. The ISS program debate is also focused on the issues of equity, access, and school capacity, as well as whether the policy is based on the basic principles of quality and equitable access that guide education in Indonesia. The current RSBI program is also seen as not affordable and none of the RSBIs have achieved ISS status. Very few, in fact, are meeting standards. Requirement to teach English becomes a barrier for teachers and students to understand the material.</p>

<p>Some proposed options include maintaining current ISS policy; terminating the RSBI program, as it has also been criticized that it discriminates against disadvantaged children and children from lower socioeconomic strata although termination of the program could have a negative impact in community coherence and education quality improvement motivation in the future, etc. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=24"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>Indonesia has been improving the gender equity in education since the last decade, by taking further steps to provide equal access for both genders. The country commits&nbsp;to the <a href=""http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/"" target=""_blank"">Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</a> and <a href=""http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/"" target=""_blank"">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> of including&nbsp;gender equity in both primary and secondary education, as well as in early childhood, technical and vocational, and higher education. Gender parity at all levels of the education system and literacy rates for Indonesia&rsquo;s youth (15-24 age group) have been greatly achieved. These achievements came from a combination of effective policies and national investments in education that have expanded school availability in <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=3"" target=""_blank"">rural areas</a> the lowered the school costs.</p>

<p>Some issues include, but are not limited to, lack of a clear strategic direction for gender mainstreaming in education; limited specialist technical capacity; the needs of improvement of the government staff sensitivity in this area, because many pioneers in this field have retired and gender equality skills and knowledge have not been regenerated; the failure to notice in training teachers to treat females and males equally through sharing tasks&nbsp;and participation in the classroom, etc.</p>

<p>The proposed options are the need for gender expertise in the government staff to implement and maintain gender equality in education; train male and female team members to ensure all activities throughout the education system are gender sensitive; teachers are to encourage boys and girls to undertake certain activities, provide a sense of direction and acting as role model themselves as well as to give equal attention for them; have a comprehensive pre-service teacher training programmer and in-service school supervisor, principal, and teacher training programmes to focus on skills for improved gender responsive; and review the curricula to ensure there is no gender bias or gender stereotyping. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=25"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>The Supplemental Food for School Children Program (PMT-AS) was launched to contribute to acceleration of achievement of national development goals related to overcoming malnutrition (the incidence of stunting in children aged 6-14 years was 13.3 percent for boys and 10.9 percent for girls in 2010) achieving education for all, and poverty reduction. The PMT-AS Program was formulated to: (1) improve nutritional intake; (2) increase the physical endurance; (3) increase the attendance and learning interest; (4) increase preference for local nutritious food; (5) improve hygiene and healthy behaviors including healthy eating habits; (6) increase the community participation; and (7) increase community&rsquo;s income through the increased use of local products. During 2010 and 2011, the program was implemented by the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA). In 2010 the target was limited to regular and madrasah primary schoolchildren (SD/MI) grades 1-6, and in 2011 preschoolers (TK/RA) were added to the program.</p>

<p>ACDP conducted a study to evaluate the program and found, among others, overall good performance in meeting teacher-student ratios and numbers of teachers per school, average performance in class size and teacher education, and very poor performance for teacher and principal certification. Because <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=7"" target=""_blank"">teachers and principals</a> have important roles in managing the PMT-AS Program, their lack of education and/or certification may have impacted negatively on program implementation. Furthermore, 20% of children in the sample districts had less than three meals per day and 20 percent go without breakfast. More than half the sample schools (65% on average) rely on well water while less than 10 percent of the sample schools (8.7% on average) rely on river water. However, the quality of the water and the quantity of water availability throughout the year are unknown. The availability of sanitation facilities in the sample schools is less than satisfactory. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=26"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>Indonesia&rsquo;s two-part (MoEC &amp; MoRA) funding passage makes basic education financing here rather complicated. Basic education is mostly provided by the national education budget. 66% from MoEC, 28% MoRA, and the remaining 6% distributed to other ministries providing training and education. 60% of the national budget is transferred to sub-national governments by MoEC, while MoRA manages its fund allocation straight to schools. Another significant allocation is the school operational assistance grant (BOS), which is allocated to schools via the provincial offices. The BOS programme aimed to help the financial burden on families of sending their kids to school. Unfortunately, among its issues is the fact that although the grant is meant for development costs of a child, schools tend to use it to manage operational issues.</p>

<p>Improvements in MoEC&rsquo;s database have been made by giving unique numbers to individual students and identifiers for schools with their GPS coordinates to make an effective system for expenditure tracking. However, there are some issues with the efficient use of resources, such as the difficulty to know how money is being spent and identify where it goes. Planning and budget are more focused on the needs of the organizational units within the bureaucracy than the schools themselves; BOS and BOSDA allocations&rsquo; per-student formula does not take into account the differences in operating costs schools face due to the circumstances of, among others, their populations and locations.</p>

<p>There are also some issues in equity, such as the fact that funding for private madrasah is unequal compared to funding for state schools, including state madrasah. Also, to enable greater allocative and technical efficiencies, the education financing still needs to be integrated and simplified. Equity concerns are being addressed by BOS and to a lesser extent the BSM. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=27"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>Pada tahun 2005, skema BOS diperkenalkan dan memberikan pengaruh besar sekolah di seluruh negeri. Rencana dana BOS untuk biaya operasional sekolah merupakan inisiatif kebijakan yang paling signifikan, yang berharga bagi sekolah-sekolah di &nbsp;daerah miskin dan terpencil yang sering mengalami kekurangan dalam setiap anggaran operasional. Namun, BOS menurunkan partisipasi masyarakat dalam pendidikan karena orang tua berpendapat bahwa BOS sudah mencakup semua biaya. Disamping itu, orang tua masih diminta untuk memberikan kontribusi keuangan lainnya untuk infrastruktur, peralatan, dan biaya ekstrakurikuler.</p>

<p>Komponen utama rencana strategis Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan dan Kementerian Agama adalah untuk menggabungkan sekolah SD dan SMP (satu atap). Terlepas dari pentingnya strategi untuk meningkatkan akses yang merata, terutama di daerah terpencil, namun tidak ada jaminan adanya pembelajaran berkualitas karena banyak guru di sekolah satu atap adalah guru sekolah dasar. Karena proses perbaikan dikelola sendiri oleh sekolah, program ini membantu peningkatan sekolah berbasis manajemen, dengan melibatkan komite sekolah dan orang tua. Dengan demikian, kontribusi yang signifikan untuk meningkatkan lingkungan belajar juga bisa diberikan.</p>

<p>Beberapa masalah diantaranya ialah akses dan pendaftaran. Penyamaan APM dan APK diduga karena kesulitan dalam menyediakan akses bagi semua anak, terutama di daerah terpencil. Selain itu ada juga maslah dengan tingkat transisi, di mana sejumlah besar anak-anak masih tidak melanjutkan studi mereka setelah tingkat dasar. Anak-anak putus sekolah cenderung berasal dari keluarga dengan status sosial ekonomi rendah, masing-masing sebesar 64,4% anak usia 7-12 tahun dan 50% anak usia 13-15 tahun. Masalah lainnya adalah kualifikasi dan penyebaran guru, di mana guru cenderung lebih suka untuk ditempatkan di perkotaan daripada di pedesaan. Untuk mengatasi masalah ini, pemerintah pusat membuat keputusan untuk mendistribusikan guru di seluruh provinsi; pemerintah provinsi dapat mendistribusikan guru di seluruh kabupaten; dan pemerintah kabupaten dapat mendistribusikan guru di daerah mereka. Pada kenyataannya, keputusan ini secara administratif sulit untuk diterapkan,&nbsp;dll. Baca lebih lanjut</p>

<p>Ada beberapa jenis pendidikan menengah atas (SMA) di Indonesia, seperti formal, non-formal, dan informal. Pendidikan menengah atas&nbsp; diberikan melalui sekolah umum menengah atas (SMA), sekolah menengah atas kejuruan (SMK), dan Madrasah Aliyah / MA. Pendidikan menengah atas &nbsp;non formal terdiri dari Paket pendidikan menengah atas &nbsp;(Paket C), yang setara dengan SMA. Paket inilebih banyak berkonsentrasi pada SMA dan MA, meskipun pedoman untuk SMK sudah dibuat&nbsp; terkait &nbsp;kesetaraan gender.</p>

<p>Pendidikan menengah atas telah diperluas oleh sekolah menengah swasta yang dalam hal jumlah sekolah terus mendominasi sub-sektor ini. Sekitar 70% dari sekolah menengah atas, sekolah yang dikelola swasta cenderung memiliki pendaftaran yang jauh lebih rendah dari sekolah umum.</p>

<p>Permasalahan yang muncul diantaranya ialah pendidikan menengah atas negeri tampaknya lebih efisien daripada sistem sekolah swasta; ketidaksetaraan geografis - kesenjangan daerah mungkin tidak berpengaruh pada pendaftaran pendidikan menegah atas ini; ketidaksetaraan gender - rasio perempuan dan laki-laki menurun selama dekade terakhir, mungkin karena banyak program studi yang ditawarkan di SMK dianggap berhubungan dengan pekerjaan laki-laki dan pendidikan di SMA dipandang lebih sesuai untuk perempuan; dan inefisiensi dalam pendidikan menengah terkait tingkat putus sekolah dan pengulangan serta rasio siswa / guru yang rendah.

<p>Setelah pemerintah memasukan sub-sektor kejuruan sebagai strategi penting dalam pembangunan ekonomi, pendaftaran di pendidikan kejuruan dan pelatihan di Indonesia meningkat 158% antara tahun 2001 dan 2010. Namun, pertumbuhan yang signifikan ini cenderung &nbsp;menjadikannya supply driven daripada demand-driven, masalahpun muncul karena keterampilan lulusan dari pendidikan dan pelatihan kejuruan harus disesuaikan dengan tuntutan pasar tenaga kerja. Pendidikan dan pelatihan kejuruan diselenggarakan melalui layanan formal dan non-formal. Pendidikan kejuruan formal lebih besar dari dua sub-sektor lain dan diberikan pada tingkat menengah melalui sekolah-sekolah kejuruan menengah atas (SMK) dan tingkat pendidikan tinggi melalui Diploma I, II, III, dan IV termasuk program 3-tahun di politeknik dan akademi &nbsp;yang diselenggarakan baik oleh kedua lembaga pemerintah maupun swasta.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Semua undang-undang yang berhubungan dengan pendidikan mengamanatkan tentang pendidikan kejuruan di tingkat menengah dan tinggi. Dilaksanakan oleh Badan Standar Nasional Pendidikan (BSNP), Standar Nasional Pendidikan (SNP) menetapkan standar untuk pendidikan kejuruan. Direktorat Jenderal (Ditjen) Pendidikan Menengah Atas memiliki tanggung jawab utama untuk mengawasi pendidikan kejuruan formal di tingkat pendidikan menengah atas. Tanggung jawab untuk pendidikan kejuruan di tingkat pendidikan tinggi berada dibawah Ditjen Pendidikan Tinggi. Pelatihan kejuruan non-formal merupakan tanggung jawab Ditjen Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini, Pendidikan Non-formal, dan Pendidikan Informal, yang berada di Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan. Sistem baru yang dikenalkan dalam Keputusan Menteri Pendidikan no. 36 / O / 1997 hanya memiliki satu jenis sekolah menengah kejuruan (SMK) dari enam jenis yang sebelumnya ada. Dalam sistem ini, sebuah SMK dapat memberikan berbagai mata pelajaran kejuruan dan tidak mengkhususkan diri hanya dalam bidang terbatas.</p>

<p>Beberapa masalah diantaranya: ketersediaan dan permintaan - pendidikan harus dilakukan dengan pendekatan berbasis permintaan, karena pendekatan berbasis ketersediaan tidak dapat &nbsp;membekali siswa dengan keterampilan yang sesuai dengan tuntutan industri. Untuk membuat perencanaan dan pelayanan yang lebih baik, analisis rutin permintaan pada sumber daya manusia harus dilakukan untuk lebih melayani pasar tenaga kerja; perbedaan gender - satu-satunya perbedaan yang signifikan dalam hal gender dan pendaftaran pada sub-sektor pendidikan menengah atas adalah tingkat pendaftaran perempuan di sekolah menengah kejuruan; angka putus sekolah - angka putus sekolah turun naik selama dekade terakhir. Angka putus sekolah yang lebih tinggi dari SMK berhubungan dengan status sosial-ekonomi karena siswa umumnya berasal dari keluarga dengan status ekonomi rendah dibanding dengan rekan-rekan SMA mereka, dll.

<p>UU Pendidikan Nasional menetapkan Sekolah Berstandar Internasional untuk menyelenggarakan satuan pendidikan bertaraf internasional dalam rangka mempersiapkan siswa agar mampu bersaing di lapangan internasional. Tujuan UU No. 20/2003 adalah untuk membentuk standar pendidikan yang meliputi satuan bersandar internasional sebagai strategi untuk meningkatkan kualitas. UU mengenai Sekolah Berstandar Internasional &nbsp;dipertanyakan beberapa tahun terakhir ini dan saat ini sedang ditinjau oleh Mahkamah Konstitusi.</p>

<p>Kualifikasi SBI adalah bahwa sekolah harus memenuhi delapan Standar Nasional Pendidikan (SPN). Karakteristik &nbsp;dan persyaratan umum SBI menurut Peraturan Menteri 78/2009 adalah: (i) menggunakan bahasa Inggris sebagai pengantar dalam sains, matematika, dan mata pelajaran kejuruan; (ii) mengadopsi kurikulum dan standar akreditasi dari OECD atau negara maju lainnya; (iii) terakreditasi oleh sekolah dari OECD atau negara maju lainnya; terlibat dan berkolaborasi dengan luar negeri sebagai &ldquo;sister school &rdquo; ( iv) mewajibkan guru dan kepala sekolah memiliki gelar&nbsp; S2 (master) (v) memiliki fasilitas TIK yang lengkap; dan lain-lain</p>

<p>Beberapa permasalahan menunjukan fakta bahwa pelatihan khusus RSBI terkait manajemen, administrasi, dan monitoring dan evaluasi belum diterima oleh pegawai provinsi dan kota / kabupaten yang bertanggung jawab mengelola RSBI. Pembicaraan tentang SBI biasanya terkait &nbsp;dengan beberapa permasalahan tentang pemerataan, akses &nbsp;dan kapasitas sekolah, serta apakah kebijakan tersebut didasarkan pada prinsip-prinsip dasar kualitas dan pemerataan akses yang memandu pendidikan di Indonesia. Program RSBI saat ini juga dianggap tidak terjangkau dan tidak ada satupun RSBIs telah mencapai status SBI.Pada kenyataaannya,&nbsp; Sangat sedikit diantaranya yang &nbsp;memenuhi standar. Persyaratan untuk mengajar dalam bahasa Inggris menjadi permasalahan bagi guru dan siswa untuk memahami materi.</p>

<p>Beberapa opsi yang diajukan diantaranya ialah mempertahankan kebijakan SBI saat ini; menghentikan program RSBI, karena banyak kritik yang menyatakan bahwa pendidikan ini mendiskriminasi anak yang kurang beruntung dan anak-anak dari strata sosial ekonomi rendah meskipun penghentian program bisa berdampak negatif pada koherensi masyarakat dan motivasi peningkatan kualitas pendidikan di masa depan, dll.

<p>Indonesia telah meningkatkan kesetaraan gender dalam pendidikan sejak dekade terakhir dengan mengambil langkah-langkah lebih lanjut untuk memberikan akses yang sama pada kedua gender. Negara ini berkomitmen untuk Millenium Development Goals (MDG) dan Tujuan Pembangunan Berkelanjutan (SDG). MDG dan SDG mamasukan kesetaraan gender dalam pendidikan dasar dan menengah, serta pendidikan anak usia dini, teknis dan kejuruan, dan pendidikan tinggi. Kesetaraan gender di semua tingkat sistem pendidikan dan tingkat literasi untuk pemuda Indonesia&nbsp; (kelompok usia 15 - 24) telah tercapai. Gabungan antara&nbsp; kebijakan yang efektif dan investasi nasional pendidikan telah memperluas ketersediaan sekolah dengan biaya yang kecil di daerah pedesaan.</p>

<p>Beberapa permasalahan yang timbul diantaranya ialah&nbsp; arah strategis pengarusutamaan gender dalam pendidikan masih kurang jelas; terbatasnya pengembangan teknis untuk keahlian;&nbsp; perlunya peningkatan&nbsp; sensitivitas pegawai pemerintah di daerah, karena banyak pelopor dalam bidang ini telah pensiun sementara keahlian dan&nbsp; pengetahuan mengenai kesetaraan gender tidak diregenarasi; belum adanya pelatihan guru yang memperlakukan wanita dan pria sama dalam pembagian tugas dan partisipasi didalam kelas.</p>

<p>Pilihan yang diusulkan adalah kebutuhan agar para pegawai pemerintah memiliki keahlian gender untuk dapat menerapkan dan memelihara kesetaraan gender dalam pendidikan; melatih laki-laki dan anggota tim perempuan untuk memastikan semua kegiatan di seluruh sistem pendidikan sensitif terhadap gender; guru mendorong anak laki-laki dan perempuan melakukan kegiatan, memberikan arah dan bertindak sebagai panutan untuk diri sendiri maupun untuk memberikan perhatian yang sama bagi mereka; memiliki program pelatihan guru pra-jabatan dan dalam jabatan yang komprehensif untuk pengawas, kepala sekolah, dan guru dengan fokus pada keterampilan agar responsif pada gender; dan meninjau kurikulum untuk memastikan tidak ada bias gender atau stereotip gender.

<p>Pemberian Makanan Tambahan Anak Sekolah (PMT - AS) diluncurkan untuk mendorong percepatan pencapaian tujuan pembangunan nasional terkait upaya untuk mengatasi gizi buruk (jumlahnya cukup mengejutkan anak usia 6 - 14 tahun sebesar 13,3 persen untuk anak laki-laki dan 10,9 persen untuk anak perempuan pada tahun 2010) mewujudkan pendidikan untuk semua, dan mengurangi kemiskinan. Program PMT - AS dibuat untuk: (1) meningkatkan asupan gizi; (2) meningkatkan ketahanan fisik; (3) meningkatkan minat untuk hadir dan belajar; (4) menambah preferensi untuk makanan bergizi lokal; (5) meningkatkan kebersihan dan perilaku sehat termasuk kebiasaan makan yang sehat; (6) meningkatkan partisipasi masyarakat; dan (7) meningkatkan pendapatan masyarakat melalui peningkatan penggunaan produk lokal. Selama tahun 2010 dan 2011, program ini dilaksanakan oleh Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan (Kemendikbud) dan Kementerian Agama (Kemenag). Pada tahun 2010 targetnya &nbsp;terbatas pada sekolah dasar umum dan madrasah (SD / MI) kelas 1 - 6, dan pada tahun 2011 anak-anak prasekolah (TK / RA) juga dimasukan dalam program.</p>

<p>ACDP melakukan penelitian untuk mengevaluasi program dan menemukan, antara lain, adanya kinerja yang baik secara keseluruhan dalam memenuhi rasio siswa guru serta jumlah guru per sekolah guru-murid, kinerja rata-rata berdasarkan ukuran kelas dan pendidikan guru, dan kinerja sertifikasi guru dan kepala sekolah yang sangat buruk. Karena guru dan kepala sekolah memiliki peran penting dalam mengelola Program PMT-AS, rendahnya pendidikan dan / atau sertifikasi dapat berdampak negatif pada pelaksanaan program. Disamping itu, 20 persen anak-anak di kabupaten sampel makan kurang dari tiga kali per hari dan 20 persen pergi sekolah tanpa sarapan. Lebih dari separuh sekolah sampel (65 persen) mengandalkan air sumur sementara kurang dari 10 persen dari sekolah sampel (rata-rata 8,7 persen) bergantung pada air sungai. Namun, kualitas air dan kuantitas ketersediaan air sepanjang tahun tidak diketahui. Ketersediaan fasilitas sanitasi di sekolah sampel kurang dari memuaskan. Baca lebih lanjut</p>

<p>Adanya dua jenis pendanaan di Indonesia&nbsp; (Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan &amp; Kementerian Agama) membuat pembiayaan pendidikan dasar menjadi agak rumit. Pendidikan dasar sebagian besar disediakan oleh anggaran pendidikan nasional. 66% dari Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, 28% dari Kementerian Agama, dan sisanya 6% didistribusikan ke kementerian lain yang memberikan pelatihan dan pendidikan. Sekitar 60% dari anggaran nasional ditransfer ke pemerintah daerah oleh Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, sedangkan Kemenag mengelola alokasi dana langsung ke sekolah-sekolah. Alokasi signifikan lain adalah Bantuan sekolah operasional / BOS, yang dialokasikan ke sekolah-sekolah melalui kantor provinsi. Program BOS bertujuan untuk membantu beban keuangan keluarga dalam menyekolahkan anak-anaknya. Sayangnya, meskipun hibah tersebut dimaksudkan untuk biaya pengembangan anak, sekolah biasanya menggunakannya untuk mengelola masalah operasional.</p>

<p>Perbaikan basis data dilakukan oleh Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan dengan cara memberikan nomor unik untuk masing-masing siswa dan pengenal untuk sekolah dengan koordinat GPS untuk membuat sistem pelacakan pengeluaran yang efektif. Namun, ada beberapa masalah dalam penggunaan sumber daya yang efisien, misalnya kesulitan untuk mengetahui bagaimana dan kemana uang dibelanjakan. Perencanaan dan anggaran lebih terfokus pada kebutuhan unit-unit organisasi dalam birokrasi daripada sekolah itu sendiri; Formula alokasi BOS dan BOSDA per - siswa tidak &nbsp;memperhitungkan perbedaan biaya operasional sekolah yang disebabkan, antara lain, faktor populasi dan lokasi mereka.</p>

<p>Ada juga beberapa masalah mengenai pemerataan, seperti adanya fakta bahwa dana untuk madrasah swasta tidak setara dibandingkan dengan dana untuk sekolah negeri, termasuk madrasah negeri. Juga, dalam mendorong efisiensi pengalokasian dan teknis, pembiayaan pendidikan masih perlu diintegrasikan dan disederhanakan. Masalah pemerataan diatasi melalui BOS dan pada tingkat lebih rendah dengan BSM. Baca lebih lanjut</p>

"2","1","Early Childhood Education","<p dir=""ltr"">International educational research and recent findings in cognitive science have highlighted the importance and advantage of early childhood development (ECD). From the period before a child is born until their eighth birthday, the central nervous system, brain cells and neural pathways are being established. During this critical period of brain development, the foundation for a child&rsquo;s future life trajectory is set. The magnitude of benefits derived from cognitive stimulation provided during the ages of 0-4 has led researchers to call this the &lsquo;golden period&rsquo; of development. In it, cognitive, social and emotional development take&nbsp;place, which will eventually affect the health, learning and behavior throughout a person&rsquo;s life. Cognitive neuroscientists refer to this as the &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; period.&nbsp;A&nbsp;child that does not receive the necessary stimulation to develop the brain during this time&nbsp;will have irreparable damage in school and later life.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">At a national conference on ECD held in Jakarta in October 2012, followed by an international conference where specialists from many countries deliberated on the importance of ECD in the post MDG agenda, Indonesia strongly recommended that the global forum give priority to the essential role of the early years in shaping individuals&rsquo; and societies&rsquo; well-being by creating a new development goal specifi cally for ECD. Indonesia supports the notion that all children have the right to develop to their full potential by growing up physically healthy, mentally alert, socially competent, emotionally sound, able to learn, and with the resources to live long and productive lives.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The government has also recognized the importance of Holistic Integrated (HI) ECD and of creating the links between early education and other services to facilitate a HI ECD approach. This is apparent in Indonesia&rsquo;s National Strategy and <a href=""http://www.bpkp.go.id/uu/filedownload/5/108/2580.bpkp"" target=""_blank"">Presidential Regulation 60/2013</a>, both on HI ECD&nbsp;and aiming&nbsp;to improve implementation and coordination through the establishment of a multi-agency task force.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In recent years, Indonesia has experienced a rapid increase in the number of children participating in playgroups, kindergartens and childcare services, mostly due to the government&rsquo;s active promotion of such services. Participation rates vary considerably by region and wealth. 70% of the richest 20% of households were shown to participate, while only 45% of the poorest 20% of households participated, and there are large regional disparities. Participation is also determined by a mother&rsquo;s education level. A child whose mother has at least completed primary education is 30% more likely to participate in ECD or TK by age 5. According to Puslitjak research, ECD access is also determined by families&rsquo; distance to school and transportation costs.</p>

<p>ECD is provided in formal and non-formal settings. However, much of the early-years provision in Indonesia is provided outside the formal education and health sectors. An ACDP qualitative research exercise on four-sites attempts to distinguish the different types of ECD centers that had evolved in communities, among those that developed out of community efforts and those out of institutional grant and support from the Government of Indonesia, Multilateral Donors, or NGO funding.</p>

<p>Some of the issues in ECD are local delivery&mdash;there is a poor coordination between central and provincial levels persists, making implementation of provision at district and community level problematic and overlapping and sometimes unclear division of responsibilities between central, provincial, and district levels hampers the efficient operations of ECD and HI ECD; ECD financing--public investment may not be targeted well to improve equity, as current financing models tend to favor centers with more capacity for self-financing and public support for training materials and operational support, maternal and child health components of HI ECD are more favorably resourced than ECD, etc.; quality assurance--an ACDP study found that many non-formal ECD institutions have been unable to meet all of the eight standards set out in <a href=""https://www.tusfiles.net/38uwl6smaliq"" target=""_blank"">Minister of Education and Culture&nbsp;decree No. 137/2014</a>, which presents quality control by the Ministry, and another ACDP study showed that for HI ECD teachers, personal skills, commitment and an affinity to children are more important for providing quality teaching at this level than formal qualifications.</p>

<p>The proposed options can be divided to three different levels, National, Provincial/District, and Community.&nbsp;The national level includes increasing provision and participation in early childhood care and education, and progressively raises its budget expenditure as a proportion of its total outlays; creating a flexible Development Model as a resource for districts and villages to draw upon; etc. &nbsp;The provincial/district level includes the district Offices of Education must support poor and newly established ECD that do not have enough power to raise their own funds and those which accommodate children from poor families; developing a resource bank within each district office to include materials that capture best practice in development, financing and provision of HI ECD; developing and test community-led targeting strategies for local investment in ECD and techniques for self-financing initiatives, etc. &nbsp;The community level includes educating parents on the purpose of ECD and HI ECD and informs them about what constitutes quality ECD; identifying and allocating resources to a local ECD leadership/coordination body; strengthen the outreach of Posyandu, midwives and health facilities based on local assessments, etc. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=38"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>Parents and other primary caregivers have the most significant influence on a child&rsquo;s physical, cognitive, psychosocial and emotional development. &nbsp;Each child needs at least one primary caregiver whom he or she can trust and is close to in order to have an optimal development. &nbsp;Family education or parenting education aims to improve the child and the family&rsquo;s well-being, which can be found in the studies by Harlen et. Al and the World Bank that show parents&rsquo; active role can improve a child&rsquo;s development and learning outcomes . &nbsp;It is also related to Early Childhood Development (ECD), which interventions include educating and supporting parents, developing the capacities of caregivers, and using mass communication to enhance parents and caregivers&rsquo; knowledge and practice.</p>

<p>A number of ministries in Indonesia have provided services to improve child and family well-being in children&#39;s early years,&nbsp;such as Kelas Ibu (Mother Class) by Ministry of Health and programs targeted for poor families by the Ministry of Social Affairs. Although&nbsp;there are challenges, the government has built a solid system of early childhood education&nbsp;services and ECD programs have increased over the last decade.</p>

<p>Education programs need to have the right content, delivery, and design components, to reach better results. &nbsp;Also, parenting education providers are recommended to choose a specific, meaningful set of key messages and adapt content for particularly vulnerable families. &nbsp;Recommendations to improve program design and implementation include: (i) active learning, (ii) explicit goals, (iii) sufficient duration and intensity, (iv) practice, (v) appropriate content, (vi) responsiveness, (vii) community support, and (viii) trained and competent staff.</p>

<p>QA refers to a systematic and effective process of checking to see whether a service being developed is meeting specified requirements or standards. In order to improve the capacity of children (from birth to 6 years of age) to develop and learn, ECE services should be of high quality and the providers need to be held accountable for such quality. However, the provision of high-quality ECE services is still a major challenge facing Indonesia. The initial step for the development of a QA system has already been taken in the form of the regulatory framework from the constitution itself to government, presidential and ministerial regulations and the ministry&rsquo;s strategic plan as well as the establishing of national standards for ECE services. The establishment of a <a href=""https://www.paud-dikmas.kemdikbud.go.id/"" target=""_blank"">Directorate General of Early Childhood Education and Community Education (DGPAUD DIKMAS)</a>&nbsp;in the restructuring of MoEC is an example of such move. What is critical at this stage is to ensure the effective implementation of these regulations, particularly at the decentralised district and community levels, as well as to establish the processes to assure the quality aligned to such standards is being achieved. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=39"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

","Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini","<p>Penelitian pendidikan internasional dan temuan terbaru dalam ilmu kognitif telah menyoroti esensi dan manfaat dari pengembangan anak usia dini (PAUD). Dari periode sebelum anak lahir sampai ulang tahun kedelapan mereka, sistem saraf pusat, sel-sel otak dan jalur saraf sedang dibentuk. Selama masa penting perkembangan otak ini, dasar lintasan anak untuk kehidupan masa depan diatur. Besarnya manfaat yang berasal dari stimulasi kognitif yang diberikan selama usia 0-4 membuat para peneliti menyebutnya sebagai &#39;masa keemasan &#39; perkembangan di mana pengembangan kognitif, sosial dan emosional yang berlangsung akan mempengaruhi kesehatan, belajar dan perilaku kehidupan seseorang. Ahli saraf kognitif menyebutnya sebagai masa &ldquo;<em>use it or lose it</em>&rdquo;. Jika seorang anak tidak menerima rangsangan yang diperlukan untuk pengembangan otaknya saat itu, akan ada kerusakan individu di sekolah dan kehidupannya nanti yang tidak dapat diperbaiki.</p>

<p>Pemerintah menyadari pentingnya Pengembangan Anak Usia Dini Holistik Integratif (PAUD HI) dan menciptakan hubungan antara pendidikan awal dan layanan lainnya untuk memfasilitasi pendekatan PAUD HI. Hal ini terlihat dalam Strategi Nasionadi Indonesia terkait PAUD HI dan dalam peraturan Presiden 20/2013 tentang PAUD HI, yang bertujuan untuk meningkatkan pelaksanaan dan koordinasi melalui pembentukan satuan tugas multi-lembaga.</p>

<p>Dalam beberapa tahun terakhir, jumlah anak yang berpartisipasi dalam kelompok bermain, taman kanak-kanak dan jasa perawatan anak di Indonesia mengalami peningkatan pesat, dan sebagian besar karena promosi aktif pemerintah tentang layanan tersebut. Tingkat partisipasi sangat bervariasi menurut wilayah dan kekayaan. Sekitar 70% dari terkaya 20% keluarga kelihatan berpartisipasi, sementara hanya 45% dari termiskin 20% keluarga kelihatan berpartisipasi, dan ada kesenjangan regional yang besar. Partisipasi juga ditentukan oleh tingkat pendidikan seorang ibu. Seorang anak yang ibunya setidaknya telah menyelesaikan pendidikan dasar adalah 30% lebih mungkin untuk berpartisipasi dalam PAUD atau TK pada usia 5. Menurut penelitian Puslitjak, akses terhadap PAUD juga ditentukan oleh jarak keluarga ke sekolah serta oleh biaya transportasi.</p>

<p>PAUD diselenggarakan dalam bentuk formal dan non-formal. Namun di Indonesia, penyelenggaraannya lebih banyak dilakukan oleh selain sektor formal pendidikan dan kesehatan. Dalam penelitian kualitatif ACDP pada empat bidang dilakukan untuk membedakan antara berbagai jenis pusat PAUD yang telah berkembang di masyarakat. Penelitian ini membedakan antara pusat yang dikembangkan oleh masyarakat dan pusat yang dikembangkan sebagai hasil dari hibah kelembagaan dan bantuan dari Pemerintah Indonesia, Multilateral Donor atau pendanaan LSM.</p>

<p>Beberapa masalah di PAUD adalah Local delivery &ndash;adanya koordinasi yang buruk antara tingkat pusat dan provinsi membuat pelaksanaan penyelenggaraannya di tingkat daerah dan masyarakat bermasalah dan tumpang tindih serta kadang-kadang ketidakjelasan pembagian tanggung jawab antara pusat, provinsi dan kabupaten provinsi pusat menghambat jalannya penyelenggaraan PAUD dan PAUD HI yang &nbsp;efisien; pembiayaan PAUD- investasi pemerintah mungkin tidak tepat sasaran untuk meningkatkan pemerataan, karena model pembiayaan saat ini cenderung mendorong pusat pendidikan ini agar memiliki kapasitas untuk pembiayaan sendiri dan bantuan pemerintah digunakan untuk bahan pelatihan dan operasional, komponen kesehatan ibu dan anak dalam PAUD HI &nbsp;lebih banyak mendapatkan bantuan &nbsp;dibanding PAUD, dll .; jaminan kualitas - Penelitian ACDP menemukan bahwa banyak lembaga PAUD non-formal yang tidak mampu memenuhi ke delapan standar yang ditetapkan dalam Keputusan Menteri No. 137, sebagai &nbsp;pengendali mutu yang dibuat &nbsp;oleh Kementerian, dan penelitian ACDP yang lain menunjukkan bahwa guru, keterampilan pribadi, komitmen dan afinitas pada anak-anak di dalam PAUD HI lebih mementingkan penyediaan pengajaran yang berkualitas pada tingkat tersebut daripada kualifikasi formalnya.</p>

<p>Pilihan yang diajukan dibagi menjadi tiga tingkatan yang berbeda, Nasional, Provinsi / Kabupaten, dan Masyarakat. Tingkat nasional mencakup peningkatan penyediaan dan partisipasi dalam perawatan dan pendidikan anak usia dini, dan semakin meningkatkan pengeluaran anggaran sebagai proporsi dari total pengeluaran; menciptakan Model Pengembangan yang fleksibel sebagai acuan untuk kabupaten dan desa-desa; dll. Di tingkat provinsi / kabupaten misalnya Dinas Pendidikan Kabupaten harus membantu PAUD yang jelek dan baru didirikan yang tidak memiliki kemampuan membiayai sendiri dan PAUD yang menampung anak-anak dari keluarga miskin; mengembangkan bank sumber daya di setiap daerah untuk menyimpan materi terkait praktek terbaik dalam pengembangan, pembiayaan dan penyelenggaraan PAUD HI; &nbsp;mengembangkan dan menguji strategi&nbsp; pengembangan masyarakat agar berinvestasi pada PAUD dan teknik inisiatif swadana, dll. &nbsp;Pada tingkatan masyarakat&nbsp; meliputi mengajarkan orang tua pada tujuan PAUD dan PAUD HI dan memberitahu apa yang dapat meningkatkan kualitas PAUD; mengidentifikasi dan mengalokasikan sumber daya ke PAUD; memperkuat jangkauan Posyandu, bidan dan fasilitas kesehatan berdasarkan pada kebutuhan lokal, dll.&nbsp;Baca lebih lanjut</p>

<p>Orang tua dan pengasuh utama lainnya memiliki pengaruh paling signifikan pada perkembangan fisik, kognitif, psikososial dan emosional anak. Setiap anak membutuhkan setidaknya satu pengasuh utama yang ia dapat percayai dan dekat dengannya untuk memiliki perkembangan yang optimal. Pendidikan keluarga atau pendidikan pengasuhan bertujuan untuk meningkatkan kesejahteraan anak dan keluarganya, sebagaimana diungkap dalam penelitiannya Harlen dkk dan Bank Dunia bahwa peran aktif orang tua dapat meningkatkan perkembangan dan hasil belajar anak. Hal ini juga terkait dengan Pengembangan Anak Usia Dini (PAUD), dimana intervensi yang dilakukan meliputi mendidik dan membantu orang tua, mengembangkan kapasitas pengasuh, dan menggunakan komunikasi masa untuk meningkatkan pengetahuan dan praktek orang tua dan pengasuh.</p>

<p>Sejumlah kementerian di Indonesia telah memberikan layanan peningkatan kesejahteraan anak dan keluarga pada anak-anak berusia dini seperti Kelas Ibu &nbsp;dari Departemen Kesehatan dan program untuk keluarga miskin dari Departemen Sosial. Meskipun ada permasalahan, pemerintah telah membangun sistem yang baik dalam layanan pendidikan anak usia dini dan program PAUD telah meningkat dan pesat selama dekade terakhir.</p>

<p>Program pendidikan harus memiliki komponen konten, pengelolaan, dan desain yang tepat, untuk mencapai hasil yang lebih baik. Juga, penyelenggara pendidikan orangtua disarankan untuk memilih pesan kunci tertentu, bermakna dan menyesuaiakan konten untuk keluarga rentan. Rekomendasi untuk meningkatkan rancangan program dan pelaksanaan meliputi: (i) pembelajaran aktif (ii) tujuan eksplisit (iii) durasi dan intensitas yang cukup (iv) praktek (v) konten yang sesuai (vi) responsiveness (vii) dukungan masyarakat dan (viii) staf yang terlatih dan kompeten.</p>

<p>Penjaminan mutu merupakan proses sistematis dan efektif untuk mengetahui apakah layanan yang sedang diselenggarakan memenuhi persyaratan atau standar tertentu. Dalam rangka meningkatkan kapasitas anak-anak (dari lahir sampai usia 6 tahun) untuk berkembang dan belajar, layanan PAUD harus berkualitas tinggi dan penyedianya harus bertanggung jawab untuk memenuhi kualitas tersebut. Namun, penyelenggaraan layanan PAUD yang berkualitas masih merupakan permasalahan utama yang dihadapi Indonesia. Langkah awal untuk pengembangan sistem jaminan mutu sudah dilaksanakan dalam bentuk kerangka peraturan perundang-undangan dari pemerintah, presiden dan peraturan menteri serta rencana strategis kementerian dan Penetapan standar nasional untuk layanan PAUD . Pembentukan Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini dan Pendidikan Masyarakat (Dirjen PAUD DIKMAS) dalam restrukturisasi Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan merupakan contoh dari langkah tersebut. Yang penting pada tahap ini adalah memastikan efektifitas pelaksanaan peraturan ini, terutama di tingkat kabupaten dan masyarakat, serta menetapkan proses penjaminan mutu berdasarkan standar tersebut dapat tercapai.&nbsp;Baca lebih lanjut</p>

Nevertheless, <a href=""https://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/index"" target=""_blank"">census data from the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS)</a> shows that in year 2000, the majority of indigenous Papuans live&nbsp;in dispersed rural and remote locations&nbsp; in Papua (77% and 64% in Papua and West Papua, respectively). By 2010, the numbers had&nbsp;not changed much, approximately 74% and 70% in Papua and West Papua, respectively.&nbsp;The culture of indigenous people is significantly different from the non-indigenous due to the limitation of contact with the outside world until mid-twentieth century. Unfortunaetly, development of the country in general has also not been the most equal, with most taking place still in the island of Java, where capital city Jakarta is located. Internet access is quite a dark zone the more east in Indonesia one goes.</p>

<p>Multigrade teaching and learning can be defined as where one teacher has responsibility of two or more grades or classes at the same time.&nbsp; In developing countries such as Peru, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Indonesia, the term refers to classes where grades are combined for necessity reasons.</p>

<p>It is a common practice in rural and remote areas throughout the world.&nbsp; Examples of multi-grade teaching: Finland (70% of all primary school pupils are enrolled in schools with fewer than three teachers), Portugal&nbsp;(80% of pupils attend schools with no more than two classrooms), The Philippines (8% of schools are multigrade, Mexico (22% of primary schools have only one teacher), India (77% of primary schools follow the multi-grade system), Ireland (42% of schools have two or more grade levels and 16% have three or more in a class) also in the rural and remote areas of Australia, the UK and the USA.</p>

<p>The issues include, but are not limited to, instructional materials that are often unavailable, planning that can be very time consuming, and difficulties in staffing small schools in rural and remote areas.&nbsp;Some of the proposed options are improving classroom&nbsp;strategies, developing appropriate learning materials&nbsp;and developing <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=19"" target=""_blank"">teacher&nbsp;development programs</a>.</p>

<p>A definite option is to empower and educate local communities to embrace their village school ownership and success can be done through a variation of a PRA technique.&nbsp; Village-level school boards could be conducted to formulate an agreement between the community and the Dinas Education Office. The agreements need to address the Dinas and the community&rsquo;s concerns. Another option is to have MTB-MLE bridge Bahasa Indonesia after basic literacy has been attained in the mother tongue. KPG REFORM ensures that the Kolese Pendidikan Guru (KPG) in Nabire, Merauke, Mimika (in Papua) and Sarong (in West Papua) train teachers for remote and rural schools. Review of ICT use and potential include connecting rural and isolated communities, schools and learning centers, to modern communication grids to conduct an intensive evaluation of the program&rsquo;s effectiveness as well as encouraging Universitas Cendrawasih (UNCEN) or Universitas Terbuka/The Open University (UT), to launch an education major in Rural and Remote Education that supports the career path of rural and remote teacher.</p>

<p>There are also options to improve current governance in the decentralized system. Reforms of the extensive and complex nature will need to be accompanied by significant capacity development programs.&nbsp; Governance applies to the education office from province to district, sub-district to school level, and also the wider system involved in the governing process.&nbsp; The two significant policies that will impact on the governance and equity issues are: (i) the increased allocation of Special Autonomy funds (Otsus) to the districts (ii) 5% of the 80% transferred to the districts will be earmarked for education services provided through the religious foundations (yayasan). <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=13"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>Generally, children in remote and rural areas learn the least in classrooms. With the less educated teachers and shortages of resources that the schools are suffering, it reflected poor performance on assessments of learning such as the <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=29"" target=""_blank"">Early Grade Reading Assessment</a>. Take a look at Papua and West Papua, where children do not understand the language in which they are being taught. Millions of children across Indonesia have to leave their mother tongues behind in order to learn the national language, which is not familiar to them. This signifies an uncultivated resource children bring with them when starting school, their language skills, which leads to slower and poorer learning process.</p>

<p>Mother tongue based multilingual education (MTB-MLE) could improve learning in rural and remote areas. Teaching MTB-MLE also increases respect for and pride in the use of among mother tongues among children and communities, that reduces the feeling of being &lsquo;push out of the classroom&rsquo; and contributes to the goal of 12-year compulsory education.</p>

<p>Some issues include, but are not limited to: (i) limited access to school in rural and remote areas; there is a significant number of children still lack access to education due to limited transportation causes children to abandon formal education, <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=1"" target=""_blank"">BOS</a>&nbsp;is not sufficient for rural and remote areas like Maluku and Papua where costs are higher than in other parts of Indonesia etc. To overcome these issues, some of the policy options include reviewing the allocation of BOS with a view to improving their sensitivity to varying revenue capacities and greater costs of schools according to their location, size, and student mix, increasing flexibility of school schedules and timetables in rural and remote areas to ensure that time in school does not conflict with the agricultural calendar or other economic activities, etc. (ii) quality of education in rural and remote areas; teachers in rural and remote areas tend to be less educated than teachers in urban areas, many rural districts have low student-teacher ratios because these areas have many small schools, and <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=20"" target=""_blank"">teacher absenteeism</a>.&nbsp; The policy options include amending the 24-period hour teaching time rule, revising the rule that all primary schools should have a minimum of nine teachers and train teachers to teach more than one subject and teach in multigrade classrooms, etc. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=14"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>Based on human resource indicators, all four districts in Sumba are categorized as underdeveloped and lower than the national average. 60% of Sumba village communities are disadvantaged and 13% can be considered as remote based on their index constructed from the national village potential database (PODES).</p>

<p>Sumba has a good example of the educational research use to inform policies, primarily those aiming to improve education quality in disadvantaged schools. The provincial government had invited ACDP to discuss the critical concerns related to education performance in NTT, and ultimately in Sumba, based on ACDP work in rural and remote education initiatives in Papua.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The issues include teaching quality, children&rsquo;s readiness to learn, the proportion of untrained teachers, PNS teacher supply and distribution, and sustainable resourcing for private schools.&nbsp; The proposed options such as, the Comprehensive Situation Analysis (CSA), which provides the situation evidence in Sumba primary schools to develop policy options.&nbsp; It also highlights the high repetition rate in Year 2 and a large amount of students having difficulties in reading.</p>

<p>Forum Peduli Pendidikan Sumba&mdash;FPPS (Advocacy Forum for Sumba Education) was formed to play an important role in initiating Sumba&rsquo;s policy development. It made up of the Vice Bupati in each district, the head of the Dinas Pendidikan and Bappeda in each district as the line departments supporting the policy leaders in technical aspects.&nbsp; FPPS has the role of monitoring and coordinating the commitment of all districts to take policy action for education reform as well as to report on their policy adoption, resourcing, and regulation progress.</p>

<p>Now Sumba has dedicated a mechanism for policy review and development. The districts are trained for negotiating policy positions with the central government, even though resourcing and policy implementation requires systemic capacity as well as political drivers. For technical capacity, it needs a longer time frame for development, and there are some key processes that need to be in place to sustain the policies that districts have adopted evaluation of schools and learning linked to systemic processes through the district Dinas Pendidikan, triggering intervention, strategy review, planning and budgeting; analysis of district&#39;s education financing; and government-wide usage of Dapodik data, as the comprehensive source for planning and projections.</p>

<p>National policies that impact fiscal capacity of the districts must also be reviewed in order for the districts to adequately resource quality development. Other national policies, such as in the&nbsp;early childhood education sector and the village fund allocation, may also require significant adjustment to yield the potential for improvement in educational quality. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=15"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

","Pendidikan di Daerah Pedesaan dan Terpencil","<p>Di beberapa bagian Indonesia, jumlah penduduk pribumi di daerah pedesaan dan terpencil jauh lebih kecil daripada non-pribumi yang tinggal di daerah perkotaan dan semi-perkotaan. Namun demikian, di Papua, sebagian besar penduduk asli Papua tersebar tinggal di pedesaan dan daerah terpencil (77 persen dan 64 persen masing-masing di Papua dan Papua Barat, <a href=""http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/index"" target=""_blank"">menurut BPS&nbsp;Sensus 2010</a>). Budaya masyarakat adat secara signifikan berbeda dari non-pribumi karena keterbatasan kontak dengan dunia luar sampai pertengahan abad kedua puluh. Namun, pembangunan negara secara umum belum merata, dan sebagian besar masih dilakukan di Pulau Jawa, di mana ibukota Jakarta berada. Akses internet masih di zona gelap untuk bagian timur Indonesia. Hal ini menunjukan perlunya semua pihak memiliki kepentingan untuk pengembangan pendidikan di daerah tersebut, sehingga dapat membantu mengurangi kesenjangan.</p>

<p>Pengajaran &nbsp;dan pembelajaran kelas rangkap &nbsp;adalah kelas dimana seorang guru memiliki tanggung jawab mengajar dua atau lebih kelas &nbsp;atau tingkat pada saat yang sama. Di negara-negara berkembang seperti Peru, Sri Lanka, Vietnam dan Indonesia, istilah ini mengacu pada kelas dimana beberapa tingkat digabungkan sesuai dengan kebutuhan.</p>

<p>Praktek pembelajaran di atas umum dilakukan di daerah pedesaan dan terpencil di seluruh dunia. Contoh pengajaran multi-tingkat: Finlandia (70% murid sekolah dasar terdaftar di sekolah dengan guru kurang dari tiga), Portugal: (80% siswa bersekolah dengan ruang kelas &nbsp;tidak lebih dari dua), Filipina (8% sekolah adalah kelas rangkap , Meksiko (22% sekolah dasar hanya memiliki satu guru), India (77% sekolah dasar mengikuti sistem kelas multi- tingkat), Irlandia (42% sekolah memiliki dua tingkatan kelas atau lebih dan 16% memiliki tiga kelas atau lebih) juga di daerah pedesaan dan terpencil Australia, Inggris dan Amerika Serikat.</p>

<p>Permasalahan lain adalah bahan ajar sering tidak tersedia, perencanaan membutuhkan waktu banyak, dan kesulitan dalam kepegawaian sekolah kecil di daerah pedesaan dan terpencil. Beberapa opsi yang diajukan adalah meningkatkan strategi ruang kelas, mengembangkan bahan pembelajaran yang tepat, dan membuat program-program pengembangan guru.</p>

<p>Ada beberapa program seperti: SERASI, yang menyediakan layanan kesehatan dasar dan pendidikan, memastikan pengelolaan dana desa yang transparan, dan mengadakan pembentukan kapasitas &nbsp;guru dan petugas kesehatan paralel; IPPM - Sekolah Kampung, cara yang tepat untuk memberikan layanan pendidikan lebih dekat ke desa-desa terpencil di Papua adalah dengan mendirikan sekolah-sekolah kampung di tiga desa (Betaf, Beneraf dan Yamna) di Kecamatan Pantai Timur - Kabupaten Sarmi dan melibatkan pemangku kepentingan setempat untuk membantu pelaksanaan sekolah kampung; dan Summer Institute of Linguistic (SIL International): Mapping of Language Communities and Schools, sebuah LSM yang memiliki status konsultatif dengan UNESCO, berupaya untuk memberdayakan masyarakat bahasa minoritas melalui program penelitian dan literasi, membantu masyarakat memperkenalkan bahasa mereka, memberikan pendidikan dan pengembangan dengan melestarikan keunikan budaya dan bahasa.

<p>Pilihan tertentu digunakan untuk memberdayakan dan mendidik masyarakat setempat agar merasa memiliki pada sekolah kampung dan untuk mewujudkannya dapat dilakukan melalui beberapa teknik PRA. Dewan sekolah kampung dapat dibentuk untuk merumuskan kesepakatan antara masyarakat dan Dinas Pendidikan Dinas. Kesepakatan tersebut harus mencakup &nbsp; keprihatinan Dinas dan masyarakat. Pilihan lain adalah menerapkan pengajaran dengan menggunakan bahasa ibu untuk &nbsp;menjebatani pembelajaran Bahasa Indonesia setelah keaksaraan dasar dalam bahasa ibu telah dicapai. KPG REFORM memastikan bahwa Kolese Pendidikan Guru (KPG) di Nabire, Merauke, Mimika (di Papua) dan Sarong (di Papua Barat) melatih &nbsp;guru di sekolah terpencil dan pedesaan. Ulasan tentang penggunaan dan manfaat TIK seperti menghubungkan masyarakat pedesaan dan terpencil, sekolah dan pusat pembelajaran, untuk mengembangkan komunikasi modern dalam melakukan evaluasi intensif tentang efektifitas program &nbsp;serta mendorong UNCEN atau (UT) Universitas Terbuka untuk mengadakan jurusan Pendidikan pedesaan dan terpencil yang mendukung jalur karir guru pedesaan dan terpencil.</p>

<p>Ada juga pilihan untuk meningkatkan tata kelola saat ini dalam sistem desentralisasi. Reformasi yang bersifat luas dan kompleks perlu disertai dengan program pengembangan kapasitas yang signifikan. Tata Kelola diterapkan untuk dinas pendidikan dari mulai provinsi ke kabupaten, kecamatan ke tingkat sekolah, dan juga sistem yang lebih luas yang terlibat dalam proses pemerintahan. Kedua kebijakan yang signifikan yang mempengaruhi permasalahan tata kelola dan pemerataan adalah: (i) peningkatan alokasi dana Otonomi Khusus (Otsus) ke kabupaten (ii) 5% dari 80% yang ditransfer ke kabupaten akan dialokasikan untuk layanan pendidikan yang diselenggarakan melalui yayasan keagamaan.&nbsp;Baca lebih lanjut</p>

<p>Umumnya, anak-anak di daerah terpencil dan pedesaan belajar sedikit di dalam ruang kelas. Dengan guru yang berpendidikan rendah dan kekurangan sumber daya membuat sekolah menderita, seperti terlihat pada hasil &nbsp;penilaian membaca untuk tingkat kelas awal. Sebagai contoh, Papua dan Papua Barat, di mana anak-anak tidak mengerti bahasa pengantar pengajaran. Jutaan anak-anak di seluruh Indonesia harus meninggalkan bahasa ibu mereka di belakang untuk mempelajari bahasa nasional, yang tidak terbiasa bagi mereka. Hal ini memunculkan hambatan pada pengembangan kemampuan anak saat memulai sekolah, yakni kemampuan bahasa mereka, yang mengarah pada proses pembelajaran yang lambat dan buruk.</p>

<p>Pendidikan multibahasa dengan menggunakan bahasa ibu &nbsp;(MTB - MLE) dapat meningkatkan pembelajaran di daerah pedesaan dan terpencil. Selain itu pendekatan pembelajaran ini juga meningkatkan rasa hormat dan bangga untuk menggunakan bahasa ibu di kalangan anak-anak dan masyarakat, juga mengurangi perasaan &#39; terasing dari kelas &#39; dan memberikan kontribusi untuk pencapaian tujuan wajib belajar 12 &nbsp;tahun.</p>

<p>Beberapa masalah muncul, namun tidak hanya itu yakni: (i) terbatasnya akses ke sekolah di daerah pedesaan dan terpencil; ada banyak anak-anak masih yang kurang memiliki akses pada pendidikan karena transportasi yang terbatas sehingga anak-anak memilih untuk tidak mengikuti pendidikan formal, BOS tidak cukup untuk daerah pedesaan dan terpencil seperti Maluku dan Papua di mana biaya yang dibutuhkan lebih tinggi daripada di bagian lain di Indonesia, &nbsp;dll. &nbsp;Untuk mengatasi masalah ini, ada beberapa pilihan kebijakan diantaranya meninjau pengalokasian BOS agar memperhatikan perbedaan kapasitas pendapatan dan biaya sekolah yang lebih besar tergantung lokasi, besaran, dan jumlah siswa, meningkatkan fleksibilitas jadwal sekolah dan jadwal masyarakat di pedesaan dan daerah-daerah terpencil agar waktu sekolah tidak bertentangan dengan kalender pertanian atau kegiatan ekonomi lainnya, dll. (ii) kualitas pendidikan di pedesaan dan daerah terpencil; guru-guru di pedesaan dan daerah terpencil cenderung kurang berpendidikan dibandingkan guru di daerah perkotaan, banyak daerah pedesaan yang memiliki rasio siswa-guru rendah karena daerah ini memiliki banyak sekolah kecil, dan ditambah dengan ketidakhadiran guru. Pilihan kebijakannya ialah merubah aturan keharusan &nbsp;24- jam mengajar, merevisi aturan bahwa semua sekolah dasar harus memiliki minimal sembilan guru, dan melatih guru untuk mengajar lebih dari satu mata pelajaran dan mengajar di ruang kelas rangkap, dll.&nbsp;Baca lebih lanjut</p>

<p>Berdasarkan indikator sumber daya manusia, ke empat kabupaten di Sumba dikategorikan sebagai tertinggal dan lebih rendah dari rata-rata nasional. 60% merupakan masyarakat tertinggal dan 13% merupakan masyarakat terpencil berdasarkan indeks basis data tentang potensi desa secara nasional (PODES).<br />
Sumba memiliki contoh penelitian pendidikan yang baik untuk menginformasikan kebijakan, terutama yang bertujuan untuk meningkatkan kualitas pendidikan di sekolah-sekolah tertinggal. Pemerintah provinsi mengundang ACDP untuk membahas masalah penting terkait kinerja pendidikan di NTT, dan termasuk Sumba, berdasarkan penelitian ACDP dalam inisiatif pendidikan pedesaan dan terpencil di Papua. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Permasalahan yang ada diantaranya terkait kualitas pengajaran, kesiapan anak untuk belajar, proporsi guru terlatih, ketersediaan dan pemerataan guru PNS, dan bantuan berkelanjutan untuk sekolah swasta. Pilihan yang diusulkan yaitu, Analisis Situasi yang Komprehensif (CSA), yang memberikan contoh situasi di sekolah dasar Sumba dalam mengembangkan pilihan kebijakan. Analisis &nbsp;ini juga menyoroti tingkat pengulangan yang tinggi di Tahun ke 2 karena banyaknya siswa mengalami kesulitan dalam membaca.</p>

<p>Forum Peduli Pendidikan Sumba - FPPS didirikan untuk memainkan peran penting dalam membantu pengembangan kebijakan di Sumba. Forum ini terdiri dari Wakil Bupati dari setiap kabupaten, kepala Dinas Pendidikan dan Bappeda di setiap kabupaten untuk mendukung para pemimpin kebijakan dalam aspek teknis. FPPS memiliki peran memonitor dan mengkordinasikan komitmen semua kabupaten untuk ikut serta dalam reformasi pendidikan serta melaporkan perkembangan pengambilan kebijakan, pembiayaan, dan regulasinya.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sekarang Sumba memiliki mekanisme untuk meninjau dan mengembangkan kebijakan. Kabupaten dilatih untuk menegosiasikan kedudukan &nbsp;kebijakan dengan pemerintah pusat, meskipun pembiayaan dan pelaksanaan kebijakan memerlukan kemampuan sistemik serta penggerak politik. Untuk kapasitas teknis, perlu kerangka waktu yang lebih lama untuk pengembangan, dan ada beberapa proses utama yang &nbsp;harus ada untuk mempertahankan kebijakan bahwa kabupaten telah menggunakan penilaian sekolah dan pembelajaran terkait dengan proses sistemik melalui Dinas Pendidikan, mendorong intervensi , meninjau strategi, perencanaan dan penganggaran; analisis pembiayaan pendidikan daerah; dan pemerintah - penggunaan berbagai data Dapodik, sebagai sumber komprehensif untuk perencanaan dan proyeksi.</p>

<p>Kebijakan nasional yang mempengaruhi kapasitas fiskal daerah juga harus ditinjau agar daeerah memiliki sumber daya pembangunan yang berkualitas. Kebijakan nasional lainnya, seperti di sektor PAUD dan alokasi dana desa, juga membutuhkan penyesuaian yang signifikan untuk mendorong potensi dalam peningkatan kualitas pendidikan.

These include finance and budgeting, staff management, school planning, and curriculum development roles. It thus requires principals to have upgraded skills. Principals Preparation Program (PPP) is conducted to ensure those eligible to become principals are ready for the job.</p>

<p>Two aspects of PPP considered effective are Nomor Unik Kepala Sekolah (NUKS), an official principal registration number, and PPP mentoring program. Some issues persist, including the fact that principals are applying the administrative requirements and education policy routinely, but not the skills and knowledge of instructional leaders. &nbsp;Also, in terms of PPP, unfortunately, the degree of political and bureaucratic involvement in identifying applicants into PPP and in the appointment of school principals was a problem. An option worth considering is to have LPPKS be more diligent about the Master Trainers&rsquo; attendance and performance. <a>Read more</a></p>

<p>Strategic plan for the improvement of Indonesia&rsquo;s education system includes the issues of teacher management and development. Teachers as the gatekeepers of classrooms are the epicenter of students&rsquo; learning process. Absence of a proper management system may lead not only to a worsened learning process, but also costs. Improvement of teacher management cannot come solely from teachers. Indeed, a majority of possible improvements require the right decisions and implementations by school administrators and policymakers.</p>

<p>Teacher management issues in Indonesia can be grouped into four major areas: supply, quality, distribution, and cost. These include uneven distribution of teachers, which lead to both oversupply and lower productivity. The lack of monitoring system leads to teachers&rsquo; declining quality. 24-hour rule and school-hour teacher meetings lead to <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=20"" target=""_blank"">teacher absenteeism</a>. There is also a significant increase in the cost of employing teachers and the overall education budget, which was the result of ongoing teacher certification program guaranteeing certified teachers a professional allowance equivalent to their basic pay.</p>

<p>Certainly, there are ways to fix these issues. Oversupply, for instance, can be fixed by not replacing teachers in schools that are already overstaffed. Allocating future teachers based on Teacher-Student ratio would also help. In terms of quality control, the 24-hour rule needs to be changed, and teachers should be qualified to teach two subjects. School principals and supervisors need to be trained in quality assurance in order to better utilize teachers&rsquo; time outside class when they are at schools. Last but not least, a review that measures the impact of complicated funding system for the salaries of the various types of teachers (PNS, contract and honorary) is required the issue of costs. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=42"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>One of Indonesia&rsquo;s unique characteristics is diversity, which can be seen in terms of culture, religions&nbsp;and ethnic groups. &nbsp;The government has committed in ensuring the religious tolerance among religions in Indonesia.&nbsp;Since religion is dynamic, it must be maintained. &nbsp;Although there are still problems of tolerance in Indonesia, a survey by Ministry of Religious Affairs in 2015, intended to measure and provide a snapshot of Religious Tolerance (Kerukunan Umat Beragama/KUB) in the provincial capitals, showed that religious tolerance in Indonesia is still quite high (75.36 out of 100). &nbsp;The government and public have the same interest in creating harmony, managing diversity and maintaining tolerance.</p>

<p>In addition, according to a number of studies, education is the best method to <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=36"" target=""_blank"">address intolerance and violence</a>. At the higher level, education plays an important role in shaping tolerance towards diversity and foster harmony in the society.&nbsp;The Ministry of Religious Affairs has been working with the Kwartir Nasional in organizing Wirakarya Camping of Religious Higher Education (Perkemahan Wirakarya Perguruan Tinggi Keagamaan), where many Islamic and non-Islamic higher education institutions participate. &nbsp;This activity aims to increase religious tolerance with higher-education students. Countries such as Malaysia, Morocco, and the United Kingdom have combined peace into their curriculum based on social, cultural, historical, and environmental context of each country. &nbsp;These three countries introduce education on values and culture of peace through religious education.</p>

<p>Parents and other primary caregivers have the most significant influence on a child&rsquo;s physical, cognitive, psychosocial and emotional development. &nbsp;Each child needs at least one primary caregiver whom he or she can trust and is close to in order to have an optimal development. &nbsp;Family education or parenting education aims to improve the child and the family&rsquo;s well-being, which can be found in the studies by Harlen et. Al and the World Bank that show parents&rsquo; active role can improve a child&rsquo;s development and learning outcomes. It is also related to <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=38"" target=""_blank"">Early Childhood Development (ECD)</a>, which interventions include educating and supporting parents, developing the capacities of caregivers, and using mass communication to enhance parents and caregivers&rsquo; knowledge and practice.</p>

<p>A number of ministries in Indonesia have provided services to improve child and family well-being in children early years such as Kelas Ibu (Mother Class) by Ministry of Health and programs that are targeted for poor families by Ministry of Social Affairs. Although&nbsp;there are challenges, the government has built a solid system of early childhood education &nbsp;services and ECD programs have increased and exceeded over the last decade.</p>

<p>Education programs need to have the right content, delivery&nbsp;and design components, to reach better results. &nbsp;Also, parenting education providers are recommended to choose a specific, meaningful set of key messages and adapt content for particularly vulnerable families. &nbsp;Recommendations to improve program design and implementation include: (i) active learning (ii) explicit goals (iii) sufficient duration and intensity (iv) practice (v) appropriate content (vi) responsiveness (vii) community support and (viii) trained and competent staff.</p>

<p>QA refers to a systematic and effective process of checking to see whether a service being developed is meeting specified requirements or standards. In order to improve the capacity of children (from birth to 6 years of age) to develop and learn, <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=2"" target=""_blank"">Early Childhood Education (ECE)</a>&nbsp;services should be of high quality and the providers need to be held accountable for such quality. However, the provision of high-quality ECE services is still a major challenge facing Indonesia. The initial step for the development of a QA system has already been taken in the form of the regulatory framework from the constitution itself to government, presidential and ministerial regulations and the ministry&rsquo;s strategic plan as well as the establishing of national standards for ECE services. The establishment of a <a href=""https://www.paud-dikmas.kemdikbud.go.id/"" target=""_blank"">Directorate General of Early Childhood Education and Community Education (DGPAUD DIKMAS)</a> in the restructuring of MoEC is an example of such move. What is critical at this stage is to ensure the effective implementation of these regulations, particularly at the decentralised district and community levels, as well as to establish the processes to assure the quality aligned to such standards is being achieved. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=39"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>Indonesia&rsquo;s 12-year compulsory education program is trying to build the success of its 9-year compulsory education program to achieve universal basic education.&nbsp;However, basic education services offered in both urban and rural areas have very poor quality and lack relevance to the social and economic conditions in the areas. To address the concerns regarding quality, the government has applied several programs in recent years.&nbsp;The Minimum Service Standards (MSS) aims to ensure that every school and madrasah meets at least the minimum conditions needed for quality teaching and learning to occur.</p>

<p>There are major shortfalls against minimum service standards, with no schools meeting them. A study bu EU-ADB Minimum Service Standards Capacity Development Program (MSS-CDP) found that schools in almost all areas had difficulties meeting the standards related to providing some of the key facilities and teaching resources. Books and, particularly, facilities and equipment for science teaching at both elementary and junior secondary level are too often in short supply. Critical shortfalls have been found not only in school resources and infrastructure, but also in important educational processes especially in areas such as supervision, lesson planning, and student assessment.</p>

<p>A recent OECD review of the Indonesian education system also found that currently parents and the community do not pay attention to the quality of schooling; instead, they mainly want for their children to gain an education certificate. Neither parents nor school committees are currently actively involved in school decision making and activities.</p>

<p>Some possible options to address these issue include implementing a longer-term strategy to ensure that all basic education schools/madrasahs have the facilities, including buildings and basic equipment, specified in MSS. Adjustment of <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=1"" target=""_blank"">BOS</a> payments to reflect the different operational costs of schools and madrasahs of different sizes and in different geographical areas may also be effective. In terms of gaining parents&rsquo; attention, continuous socialisation and increased understanding of and commitment to the MSS among all key stakeholders, including parents, is a viable strategy. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=43"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>Many countries seek to establish qualifications frameworks in order to increase the global mobility of workers. Qualifications framework sets standards and criteria for a nation&rsquo;s agreed qualifications and allow skills and qualifications gained elsewhere to be acknowledged. The Indonesian Qualifications Framework (IQF) was established to respond to national needs and regional and global trends of economic integration. The three main players in developing Indonesia&rsquo;s qualification framework are the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC), Ministry of Manpower (MoM) and the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education (MoRTHE).</p>

<p>The current stage of implementation of IQF varies among different sectors in Indonesia. Yet, issues such as Indonesia&rsquo;s manpower challenge continues to be a burden. There is a mismatch between education outcomes and workforce needs in Indonesia. Employers have also reported disparities in the quality and types of skills graduates attain at university. University graduates with similar qualifications often have acquired considerably different sets of skills and knowledge, and there are large variations in standards. There needs to be a quality assurance process and a national qualification framework. This will help both universities and employers. Establishment of the Indonesian Qualification Board (IQB) to coordinate all activities related to IQF and ensure synergetic effort, particularly to cope with the challenges of <a href=""http://asean.org/asean-economic-community/"" target=""_blank"">ASEAN Economic Community (AEC)</a> implementation, would be useful. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=44"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

","Tata Kelola dan Penjaminan Mutu","<p>Penjaminan mutu sebagai indikator keefektifan kegiatan belajar mengajar terdiri dari faktor-faktor yang melampaui kegiatan belajar mengajar di kelas. Hal ini sangat terkait dengan tata kelola. Kepemimpinan kepala sekolah dan pengawas sekolah menentukan kelancaran jalannya suatu sekolah. Peran mereka juga mempengaruhi bagian penting kegiatan belajar mengajar yaitu manajemen guru. Di Indonesia, penjaminan mutu juga terhubung dengan standar pelayanan minimum (MSS), yang memperhitungkan keadaan fasilitas dan sumber daya pengajaran sekolah. Sekolah di daerah yang lebih terpencil cenderung kurang memiliki infrastruktur yang tepat. Hal ini dapat berpengaruh terhadap kemampuan belajar siswa.</p>

<p>Penjaminan mutu juga terhubung dengan standardisasi kualitas para lulusan. Dunia global saat ini memungkinkan individu untuk lebih bebas berpindah ke belahan dunia lain untuk alasan apapun. Potensi yang terdapat pada satu negara tidak dapat diidentifikasi jika tidak ada standar yang sesuai. Kerangka Kualifikasi Indonesia (IQF) berusaha untuk mengatasi hal ini, namun di Indonesia pun masih ada perbedaan antara kebutuhan pendidikan tinggi dan kebutuhan tenaga kerja.</p>

<p>Kepala sekolah teladan merupakan faktor penting dalam meningkatkan efektivitas dan peningkatan mutu&nbsp; sekolah. Peraturan Menteri Indonesia&nbsp; nomor 44/2002 mengeluarkan tentang manajemen &nbsp;berbasis sekolah, yang menempatkan kepala sekolah sebagai pembuat keputusan utama&nbsp; misalnya dalam urusan keuangan dan penganggaran, manajemen staf, perencanaan sekolah, dan peran pengembangan kurikulum. Karenanya kepala sekolah harus senantiasa meningkatkan keterampilannya. Program Persiapan Kepala Sekolah (PPKS) diadakan untuk memastikan mereka yang memenuhi syarat menjadi kepala sekolah adalah yang siap untuk pekerjaan itu.</p>

<p>Dua aspek PPKS yang dianggap penting yaitu Nomor Unik Kepala Sekolah (NUKS), sebuah nomor resmi pendaftaran kepala sekolah, dan program mentoring PPKS. Beberapa masalah tetap ada misalnya fakta bahwa ada kepala sekolah yang memenuhi ketentuan administrasi dan kebijakan pendidikan, tetapi tidak memenuhi keterampilan dan pengetahuan sebagai pemimpin &nbsp;pendidikan. Selain itu, &nbsp;sayangnya adanya kepentingan &nbsp;politik dan birokrasi dalam penentuan calon yang ikut serta dalam PPKS dan dalam &nbsp;pengangkatan kepala sekolah. Pilihan kebijakannya adalah mendorong agar kehadiran dan kinerja Master Trainer LPPKS lebih ditingkatkan.&nbsp;Baca lebih lanjut</p>

<p>Pengawas sekolah diharapkan untuk bertindak sebagai manajer pendidikan dan &#39; pemimpin belajar &#39; .&nbsp; Mereka harus memastikan penerapan standar pendidikan seperti 1) memeriksa dan mengevaluasi, dan 2) menasihati, membantu, dan mendukung guru dan kepemimpinan sekolah. Perdebatan global terus adalah apakah pengawas sekolah harus fokus satu atau yang lain. Peraturan Menteri Pendayagunaan Aparatur Negara dan Birokrasi nomor &nbsp;21 tahun 2010 menjelaskan bahwa pengawas adalah &ldquo; PNS ... bertanggung jawab ... untuk melakukan pengawasan akademik dan manajerial pada satuan pendidikan&rdquo;. Pengawas sekolah harus memenuhi Standar Pelayanan Minimum (SPM), dan kompetensi yang dibutuhkan pengawas sekolah ditetapkan lebih lanjut dalam Keputusan Menteri 12/2007. Peraturan Menteri Nomor 21 Tahun 2010 juga menguraikan tugas utama supervisor, diantaranya ialah melaksanakan &nbsp;monitoring &nbsp;terhadap delapan Standar Nasional Pendidikan Indonesia.</p>

<p>Permasalahan utama yang banyak disebut &nbsp;dalam berbagai publikasi mengenai pengawasan sekolah di Indonesia adalah proses perekrutan. Beberapa menyarankan bahwa pengawas harus memiliki pengalaman di posisi kepemimpinan sekolah. Permasalahan lain terkait pengawas yaitu adanya fakta bahwa pengawas biasanya dinilai &nbsp;tinggi dalam dimensi&nbsp; kompetensi &nbsp;&ldquo;Sosial &rdquo; dan &ldquo; Pribadi &rdquo; dan rendah &nbsp;dalam dimensi&nbsp; &ldquo; Penelitian &rdquo; dan &ldquo; Pengawasan Akademik &rdquo; , dengan variasi yang cukup besar antar daerah. Sebagian besar pengawas juga memiliki sedikit pemahaman tentang isi dari Standar Nasional Pendidikan atau bagaimana standar tersebut dapat digunakan untuk kepentingan sekolah dan belajar siswa. Pilihan yang layak dipertimbangkan adalah Sebagai pengganti dari Peraturan Menteri 21 tahun 2010 mengenai &nbsp;persyaratan jabatan pengawas yang hanya untuk guru dengan status PNS, beberapa menyarankan agar pengawas memiliki pengalaman memimpin sekolah sebelumnya.

<p>Rencana strategis untuk perbaikan sistem pendidikan Indonesia meliputi permasalahan manajemen dan pengembangan guru. Guru sebagai penjaga ruang kelas merupakan pusat dari proses pembelajaran siswa. Tidak adanya sistem manajemen yang tepat dapat menyebabkan tidak hanya proses belajar &nbsp;yang memburuk, tetapi juga biaya. Peningkatan manajemen guru tidak bisa datang hanya dari guru. Oleh karena itu, mayoritas perbaikan membutuhkan keputusan yang tepat dan pelaksanaannya oleh para pelaksana sekolah dan pembuat kebijakan.</p>

<p>Permasalahan seputar manajemen guru di Indonesia dapat dikelompokkan ke dalam empat bidang utama: ketersediaan, kualitas, penyebaran, dan biaya. Selain itu juga penyebaran guru yang tidak merata, yang menyebabkan kelebihan ketersediaan dan produktivitas yang lebih rendah. Kurangnya sistem monitoring menyebabkan penurunan kualitas guru. Aturan keharusan mengajar 24 jam pelajaran serta - pertemuan guru &nbsp;saat jam sekolah menyebabkan ketidakhadiran guru. Ada juga peningkatan yang signifikan dalam biaya mempekerjakan guru dan anggaran pendidikan secara keseluruhan, yang merupakan akibat dari program sertifikasi guru yang menjamin guru tersertifikasi mendapatkan tunjangan profesional setara dengan gaji pokok mereka.</p>

<p>Tentu saja, ada cara untuk memperbaiki masalah ini. Kelebihan ketersediaan, misalnya, bisa diperbaiki dengan tidak mengganti guru di sekolah yang sudah kelebihan staf. Mengalokasikan guru baru berdasarkan rasio siswa &ndash;guru juga akan membantu. Dalam hal pengenadalian mutu, aturan 24 &ndash; jam mengajar &nbsp;harus diubah, dan guru harus memiliki kualifikasi mengajar untuk dua mata pelajaran. Kepala sekolah dan pengawas perlu dilatih tentang jaminan mutu dalam rangka untuk lebih memanfaatkan waktu guru&nbsp; di luar kelas ketika mereka berada di sekolah. Yang terakhir adalah adanya review yang mengukur dampak dari sistem pendanaan yang rumit untuk gaji berbagai jenis guru (PNS, kontrak dan honorer) diperlukan guna mengatasi &nbsp;persoalan biaya.

<p>Salah satu karakteristik unik Indonesia adalah kebinekaan, yang terlihat dalam budaya, agama, dan kelompok etnis. Pemerintah telah berkomitmen menjamin toleransi beragama di antara agama-agama di Indonesia. Karena agama bersifat dinamis, maka harus dipertahankan. Meskipun masih ada masalah toleransi di Indonesia, survei Kementerian Agama pada tahun 2015, dimaksudkan untuk mengukur dan memberikan gambaran tentang Toleransi Keagamaan (Kerukunan Umat Beragama / KUB) di ibukota provinsi, menunjukkan bahwa toleransi beragama di Indonesia masih cukup tinggi (75,36 dari 100). Pemerintah dan masyarakat memiliki kepentingan yang sama dalam menciptakan kerukunan, mengelola kebhinekaan dan memelihara toleransi.</p>

<p>Selain itu, menurut sejumlah penelitian, pendidikan adalah metode terbaik untuk mengatasi intoleransi dan menghilangkan kekerasan yang &nbsp;dapat mengganggu kerukunan. Pada tingkat yang lebih tinggi, pendidikan memainkan peran penting dalam membentuk toleransi terhadap kebinekaan dan menumbuhkan kerukunan di masyarakat. Kementerian Agama telah bekerja dengan Kwartir Nasional dalam menyelenggarakan Perkemahan Wirakarya Perguruan Tinggi Keagamaan, di mana banyak lembaga pendidikan tinggi Islam dan non-Islam berpartisipasi. Kegiatan ini bertujuan untuk meningkatkan toleransi beragama dengan siswa pendidikan tinggi. Negara-negara seperti Malaysia, Maroko, dan Inggris telah memasukan perdamaian ke dalam kurikulum mereka berdasarkan konteks sosial, budaya, sejarah, dan lingkungan masing-masing negara. Ketiga negara memperkenalkan pendidikan nilai-nilai dan budaya perdamaian melalui pendidikan agama.</p>

<p>Orang tua dan pengasuh utama lainnya memiliki pengaruh paling signifikan pada perkembangan fisik, kognitif, psikososial dan emosional anak. Setiap anak membutuhkan setidaknya satu pengasuh utama yang ia dapat percayai dan dekat dengannya untuk memiliki perkembangan yang optimal. Pendidikan keluarga atau pendidikan pengasuhan bertujuan untuk meningkatkan kesejahteraan anak dan keluarganya, sebagaimana diungkap dalam penelitiannya Harlen dkk dan Bank Dunia bahwa peran aktif orang tua dapat meningkatkan perkembangan dan hasil belajar anak. Hal ini juga terkait dengan Pengembangan Anak Usia Dini (PAUD), dimana intervensi yang dilakukan meliputi mendidik dan membantu orang tua, mengembangkan kapasitas pengasuh, dan menggunakan komunikasi masa untuk meningkatkan pengetahuan dan praktek orang tua dan pengasuh.</p>

<p>Sejumlah kementerian di Indonesia telah memberikan layanan peningkatan kesejahteraan anak dan keluarga pada anak-anak berusia dini seperti Kelas Ibu&nbsp; dari Departemen Kesehatan dan program untuk keluarga miskin dari Departemen Sosial. Meskipun ada permasalahan, pemerintah telah membangun sistem yang baik dalam layanan pendidikan anak usia dini dan program PAUD telah meningkat dan pesat selama dekade terakhir.</p>

<p>Program pendidikan harus memiliki komponen konten, pengelolaan, dan desain yang tepat, untuk mencapai hasil yang lebih baik. Juga, penyelenggara pendidikan orangtua disarankan untuk memilih pesan kunci tertentu, bermakna dan menyesuaiakan konten untuk keluarga rentan. Rekomendasi untuk meningkatkan rancangan program dan pelaksanaan meliputi: (i) pembelajaran aktif (ii) tujuan eksplisit (iii) durasi dan intensitas yang cukup (iv) praktek (v) konten yang sesuai (vi) responsiveness (vii) dukungan masyarakat dan (viii) staf yang terlatih dan kompeten.</p>

<p>Jaminan mutu merupakan proses sistematis dan efektif untuk mengetahui apakah layanan yang sedang diselenggarakan memenuhi persyaratan atau standar tertentu. Dalam rangka meningkatkan kapasitas anak-anak (dari lahir sampai usia 6 tahun) untuk berkembang dan belajar, layanan PAUD harus berkualitas tinggi dan penyedianya harus bertanggung jawab untuk memenuhi kualitas tersebut. Namun, penyelenggaraan layanan PAUD yang berkualitas masih merupakan permasalahan utama yang dihadapi Indonesia. Langkah awal untuk pengembangan sistem jaminan mutu sudah dilaksanakan dalam bentuk kerangka peraturan perundang-undangan dari pemerintah, presiden dan peraturan menteri serta rencana strategis kementerian dan Penetapan standar nasional untuk layanan PAUD . Pembentukan Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini dan Pendidikan Masyarakat (Dirjen PAUD DIKMAS) dalam restrukturisasi Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan merupakan contoh dari langkah tersebut. Yang penting pada tahap ini adalah memastikan efektifitas pelaksanaan peraturan ini, terutama di tingkat kabupaten dan masyarakat, serta menetapkan proses penjaminan mutu berdasarkan standar tersebut dapat tercapai.

<p>Program wajib belajar Indonesia &nbsp;12 tahun berupaya untuk mengulang kesuksesan Program Wajib Belajar 9 tahun ddalam mencapai pendidikan dasar universal. Namun, layanan pendidikan dasar yang ada baik di daerah perkotaan dan pedesaan memiliki kualitas yang jelek dan kurang relevan dengan kondisi sosial dan ekonomi di daerah. Untuk mengatasi masalah kualitas ini, pemerintah telah menerapkan beberapa program dalam beberapa tahun terakhir. Standar Pelayanan Minimum (SPM) bertujuan untuk memastikan bahwa setiap sekolah dan&nbsp; madrasah memenuhi setidaknya kondisi minimum yang dibutuhkan pengajaran dan pembelajaran yang berkualitas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ada banyak kekurangan dalam standar pelayanan minimum, dimana tidak ada sekolah yang bisa memenuhinya. Sebuah penelitian dalam Program antara Uni Eropa-ADB terkait Pengembangan Kapasitas Standar Pelayanan Minimum (MSS-CDP) menemukan bahwa sekolah di hampir semua daerah mengalami kesulitan memenuhi standar terkait penyediaan beberapa fasilitas dan sumber daya pengajaran. Buku dan, khususnya, fasilitas serta peralatan untuk mengajar sains baik di tingkat SD maupun &nbsp;SMP sering tidak tersedia. Beberapa kelemahan telah ditemukan tidak hanya dalam sumber daya sekolah dan infrastruktur, tetapi juga dalam proses pendidikan khususnya dalam bidang-bidang seperti pengawasan, perencanaan pelajaran, dan penilaian siswa.</p>

<p>Tinjauan OECD baru-baru ini pada sistem pendidikan di Indonesia juga menemukan bahwa saat ini orang tua dan masyarakat tidak memperhatikan mutu sekolah; sebaliknya, mereka hanya ingin anak-anaknya memperoleh ijasah &nbsp;pendidikan. Baik orang tua maupun komite sekolah saat ini tidak aktif terlibat dalam pengambilan keputusan dan kegiatan sekolah.</p>

<p>Beberapa opsi untuk mengatasi masalah ini diantaranya ialah &nbsp;menerapkan strategi jangka panjang untuk memastikan bahwa semua sekolah pendidikan dasar / madrasah memiliki fasilitas, seperti bangunan dan peralatan dasar, yang ditentukan dalam SPM. Penyesuaian pembayaran BOS harus memenuhi biaya operasional sekolah dan madrasah yang berbeda dari sisi ukuran dan wilayah geografis yang berbeda.Untuk mendapatkan perhatian orang tua, sosialisasi terus menerus dan peningkatan pemahaman serta komitmen terhadap SPM dari semua pemangku kepentingan, termasuk orang tua, merupakan &nbsp;strategi yang layak dipertimbangkan.

<p>Banyak negara berusaha untuk membangun kerangka kualifikasi untuk meningkatkan mobilitas global pekerja. Kerangka kualifikasi menetapkan standar dan kriteria kualifikasi bangsa yang disetujui dan memungkinkan keterampilan dan kualifikasi yang diperoleh di tempat lain untuk diakui. Kerangka Kualifikasi Nasional Indonesia (KKNI) didirikan untuk merespon kebutuhan nasional dan tren regional serta integrasi ekonomi global. Tiga pemeran utama dalam pengembangan kerangka kualifikasi nasional Indonesia adalah Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan (Kemendikbud), Kementerian Tenaga Kerja (Kemenaker) dan Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi (Kemenristekdikti).</p>

<p>Tahapan pelaksanaan KKNI beragam &nbsp;antara berbagai sektor di Indonesia. Namun, permasalahan terkait tenaga kerja Indonesia terus menjadi beban. Ada ketidaksesuaian antara hasil pendidikan dan kebutuhan tenaga kerja di Indonesia. Pengusaha juga telah melaporkan kesenjangan antara kualitas dan jenis keterampilan lulusan yang diperoleh di universitas. Lulusan universitas dengan kualifikasi yang sama seringkali berbeda keterampilan dan pengetahuannya, dan ada perbedaan yang besar dengan standar. Karena itu, proses jaminan mutu dan kerangka kualifikasi nasional perlu ada untuk membantu baik itu universitas maupun pengusaha. Pembentukan Badan Kualifikasi &nbsp;Nasional Indonesia (BKNI) untuk mengkoordinasikan semua kegiatan yang berkaitan dengan KKNI dan memastikan upaya sinergis, terutama untuk mengatasi tantangan dalam pelaksanaan masyarakat ekonomi Asean, akan berguna.

"5","1","Teaching and Learning","<p dir=""ltr"">The major changes in education in Indonesia brought about by the process of decentralization over the past decade have included a major shift in the dominant paradigm related to teaching and learning. The development and refi nement of national standards, the ongoing move from a content-based to a competency-based curriculum, and the &ldquo;institutionalization&rdquo; of a student-centered active teaching and learning model under school-based management (Manajemen Berbasis Sekolah or MBS) are all indicative of this fundamental shift. These developments have created new challenges &ndash; for example, many teachers have struggled to adopt the relatively new competency-based curriculum. Moving from a teacher-centered, rote learning approach to a student-centered approach, which encourages questioning and creativity in the classroom, has also been challenging for many teachers. Eff ective assessment of learning outcomes, particularly through national examinations, also remains a key challenge.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Teaching and Learning encompass all phases of the education system. It is a defining component of education that combines aspects ranging from teacher quality, school facilities&rsquo; availability, to curriculum effectiveness. Recent developments in information technology also plays a role in determining the latest trends in teaching and learning.</p>

Parents should involve more in playgroups and kindergarten settings as it can be very effective and can be provided on voluntary basis.</p>

<p>Indonesian teachers are asked to implement a new curriculum that was developed in 2013, which aims to improve the instructions quality in schools and madrasahs. The right support is needed for teachers and leaders in achieving a lift in teaching quality and student outcomes, such as more training, interactive teaching methods, and thematic approaches to teaching the curriculum and improve teaching quality overall.</p>

<p>A consequence of this is in terms of assessing students&#39; performance. Indonesia has been participating in several international educational assessment programs since 1999, which provide benchmarks for the students performance and teaching and&nbsp;learning success. A decline of achievements in mathematics and science has become a concern. Indonesia scored below the &ldquo;Low&rdquo; level in the Trends in International Math and Science Study (<a href=""https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/"" target=""_blank"">TIMSS</a>) in 2011--ranked 38th out of 45 countries, compared to 2007 results for the eighth-graders. In the 2011 progress in International Reading Literacy Study (<a href=""https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/"" target=""_blank"">PIRLS</a>), there was a 12% increase in reaching the &ldquo;Low&rdquo; level for the fourth-graders. Indonesia performs well under the OECD average measure in <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/"" target=""_blank"">PISA</a>. There is an improvement in mathematics and reading performance, but a decline in science performance. Across all the tests, Indonesia has a very small percentage of students in the highest performing groups and large proportion of students in the low performing group. The PISA results found no significant difference between the results achieved by MORA and MOEC junior secondary schools.</p>

<p>A few teachers have received the training on applying the <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=30"" target=""_blank"">2013 curriculum</a>. They need to fully understand the new practices before applying them in classrooms so they will not feel overwhelmed. Teachers are trained, monitored&nbsp;and supported at district level, which creates a challenge in ensuring they understand the national curriculum and understand the extent in adapting the curriculum to their local context.</p>

<p>Also, schools that seek written feedback from students are more likely to perform better. They seek feedback regarding lessons, teachers or resources, for quality assurance and improvement. They also perform better in the latest PISA assessment. Students whose voices are heard have increased achievements and engagement in school. This also opens up the opportunities for students to practice problem solving, leadership&nbsp;and creative thinking that helps decision making in their school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indonesia&rsquo;s performance in international educational assessment has not been improving. The <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=30"" target=""_blank"">2013 curriculum</a> was developed to consider the internal, external, and global challenges. Internal challenges are achieving the eight&nbsp;educational national standards which set out expectations and measurement in relation to levels of graduation competence, content of the curriculum, process of learning and teaching, teaching personnel, facilities and infrastructure, management, education financing, and education assessment. External and global challenges are ensuring education provides advantages for young people in relation to pressures on the environment, advances in technology, a need for creativity and innovation and education development</p>

<p>One of the key principles in the new curriculum is a move from a content-based to a competency-based approach where students are not simply memorizing content, but able to demonstrate to do things. This implementation needs to be monitored to ensure that a real cultural change takes place. The curriculum has been developed to be delivered to general senior (SMA) and Islamic (MA) senior secondary schools, which includes basic competencies and elective choices. The SMA/MA curricula are made of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Group A (religion, manners, civics, Bahasa Indonesia, mathematics, history, and English) and Group B (arts, health and sports, and craft and entrepreneurship) compulsory subjects.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Group C, which consists of interest-based subjects namely mathematics and science, social science, languages, and culture</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For MAs, in addition to the interest-based subjects, MORA can add other interest-based subjects.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Both A and C are developed by national government. B is developed by national government and completed by the regional government.</p>

<p>There are some reassuring practices and models, however, <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=8"" target=""_blank"">vocational education and training (VET)</a> at senior secondary level is still overwhelmed by the literature. The Ministry of Education Decree No.36/0/1997 has a new VET system that reforms major curriculum in vocational high schools (SMK) closely to local labour market needs, and gave the students an extensive foundational study for a year before they pick a specific vocational area. It introduces entrepreneurship as a solo subject or integrated with other subjects as well as urges interconnections with the local industry and business, providing opportunities for work experience and the development of other relevant skills.</p>

<p>There are two major challenges in connecting the curriculum to the industry&rsquo;s demand. First, the <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=17"" target=""_blank"">principals</a> need to have a competent expertise and background of the workplace, and able to use their networks within local ventures to improve the learning experience of the students. Second, the need of crucial grant by MoEC and MoRA to find ways of collaborating with ventures while assuring the student&rsquo;s learning process instead of using a cheap source of labour. The solution might be consideration of the ministry in providing specific training for the role of the principals and <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=18"" target=""_blank"">supervisors</a>. SMK has been criticized for its quality and irrelevance of the training.</p>

<p>There are also missed coordinations between vocational education and labour market demands. The fact that the curriculum is still arranged by MoEC, which is not coordinated with the Ministry of Industry/MoI and the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration/MoMT, leaves&nbsp;the curriculum with little input from relevant industries. Furthermore, only few industries cooperate&nbsp;with SMK in the supplies of facilities and equipment.</p>

<p>Additionally, the numbers of teachers with work experience in their area of specialization is unpredictable, which makes their education is less relevant. Often times the teachers are returning directly to the school they graduated after qualifying. Other than that, there is also no direct way of managing underperforming teachers.</p>

<p>Based on the <a href=""http://risbang.ristekdikti.go.id/regulasi/uu-12-2012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Higher Education Law</a>, each institution is to develop&nbsp;its own <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=30"" target=""_blank"">curriculum</a> with reference to the National Higher Education Standards for each study program. The curriculum needs to have a stronger link to society and industry. Theoretical studies should be applied and supported with practical studies and orientation towards application.</p>

<p>Several incentives that can be used to encourage individual lecturers and institutions to develop new teaching skills include competitive funding schemes and teaching development centers at institutions. A well-functioned teaching/learning system also depends on the flexibility and clear pathways and horizontal linkages that enable student mobility between programs and institutions. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=44"" target=""_blank"">The National Qualifications Framework (NQF)</a> is the initiative taken by the government to reach this aim.</p>

<p>Internationalization of higher education is important to raise quality. Indonesia has been behind, compared with OECD averages and some its Asian neighbors. There should be more emphasis on the internationalization of the curriculum, international benchmarking, international accreditation, joint programs, scholarship programs, etc. It is important for both students and staffs to participate in programs like Erasmus or&nbsp;the <a href=""http://www.aunsec.org/"" target=""_blank"">ASEAN University Network (AUN)</a> for mobility and quality assurance.</p>

<p>There is a need to raise the research and development (R&amp;D) budget. Research budget should be used in a more focused way, aiming to develop quality research and establish strong research programs, especially at the seven autonomous universities in the top tier, then on the second tier, public service universities, with additional criteria. &nbsp;Science, technology, engineering, and agriculture should be the highest priority in research in order to support the goals of the <a href=""http://www.kemendag.go.id/files/pdf/2012/12/06/master-plan-2011-2025-id0-1354731495.pdf"" target=""_blank"">MP3EI</a> master plan. It is important for universities to be strong, particularly in above disciplines, in order to play decisive role in the economic development. To attract <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=27"" target=""_blank"">funding</a>, universities must able to enter into co-operative partnerships with business/industry.

<p>There is an increase in research output and papers in international journals written by Indonesian researchers.

<p>An assessment must have clear and realistic standards.&nbsp;They should be guided by the curriculum and utilize tools provided by the assessment system.</p>

<p>Issues that pertain to assessment In Indonesia include, among others,&nbsp;the acknowledgment of real gap between student performance and mandated standards. This is in part due to the high number of cheating that occurs in national exams. Indonesia is also faced with frequent changes in the education system. This does not allow for an up-to-date assessment system. Assessment standards needs to adjust with time and needs of relevant stakeholders. Uncertainty in the education system, due to the aforementioned frequent changes, has led to lacks in implementing such standards. Furthermore, there is a bigger factor at play in Indonesia. Due to disparity of development and education, a continuing debate is whether standards should be set differently across the country.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, teachers still hold the key to identifying students&rsquo; skills and abilities. Teachers should be equipped with assessment literacy. There is also a need, as identified by Puspendik, to promote integrity in order to battle the habit of cheating during exams. The Ujian Nasional (UN) should also be maintained as the most reliable final assessment of students in grade 12. Streamlining it to focus on certain subjects can also be a useful strategy. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=29"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>Education is a continuous process. It adjusts accordingly to changes in other factors, including social, political, economic, etc. It therefore requires a set of standards. <a href=""http://kurikulum.kemdikbud.go.id/"" target=""_blank"">Curriculum 13 in Indonesia (K13)</a> is a form of competency-based education, standards&nbsp;and practices. Its implementation has been, unfortunately challenging, due to&nbsp; uneven professional training of teachers and lack of materials in some schools, among other reasons.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that curriculum is a source of influence. It can be a social debate and result in an economic engine. It also defines the use of resources in a country. In short, it invites friction. Therefore, curriculum reforms should be considered provocative, modifiable over time, responsive to changing conditions, and dynamic parts of a coordinated system to monitor and enhance teaching and learning in every school. In terms of K13 for instance, <a href=""http://puskurbuk.kemdikbud.go.id/"" target=""_blank"">Center for Curriculum and Books (Puskurbuk)</a> is identifying and ameliorating its implementation challenges while also considering ways to revise and improve K13.

<p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has merged into almost all of modern life aspects. It is changing the way people work, socialize and communicate, as well as has influence in the classroom practice. It has the potential to support the teaching and learning process. Teachers with ICT ensure that students have the knowledge and skills they need. It also has the potential to reduce income and geography inequities.</p>

<p>Connectivity, however, remains an issue. <a href=""https://belajar.kemdikbud.go.id/Dashboard/"" target=""_blank"">Rumah Belajar</a>, formed by Pustekkom (Centre for Information and Communication Technology for Education), was aimed to allow students and teachers to access learning materials on mobile devices.&nbsp;However, file sizes of the materials cause a challenge to those who are in the areas where the cellular bandwidth was not strong. Although schools across Indonesia have used ICT and some have well-planned and funded ICT, there are others who struggle to keep up with the technological change. Teachers also lack the knowledge and skills of technology themselves.</p>

<p>There needs to be solutions for sustainable power and improved telecommunications infrastructure, as well as alternative energy sources and innovative solutions for remote areas. Improvement of internet connectivity would definitely help. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=27"" target=""_blank"">School budgets</a> that target ICT should also be provided, including ICT related expenses such as network infrastructure and digital devices.

<p>Indonesia has been improving the gender equity in education since the last decade by taking further steps to provide equal access in both genders. The country commits to the <a href=""http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/"" target=""_blank"">Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</a> and <a href=""http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/"" target=""_blank"">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>. The MDGs and SDGs have included gender equity in both primary and secondary education, as well as in early childhood, technical and vocational, and higher education. Gender parity at all levels of the education system and literacy rates for Indonesia&rsquo;s youth (15-24 age group) have been greatly achieved. These achievements came from the combination of effective policies and national investments in education that have expanded school availability in rural areas the lowered the school costs.</p>

<p>Yet, there is still a lack of clear strategic direction for gender mainstreaming in education. There is also a &nbsp;need for improvement of government staff sensitivity in this area, because many pioneers in this field have retired and gender equality skills and knowledge have not been regenerated. There is also a failure to notice in training teachers to treat females and males equally through sharing tasks and participation in the classroom.</p>

<p>There needs to be gender expertise in the government staff to implement and maintain gender equality in education. Training for male and female team members is required to ensure all activities throughout the education system are gender sensitive. Teachers should have a comprehensive pre-service teacher training programmer and in-service school supervisor, principal&nbsp;and teacher training programmes on the matter. A review the curricula to ensure there is no gender bias or gender stereotyping is also viable. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=25"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

","Belajar Mengajar","<p>Perubahan signifikan yang disebabkan oleh proses desentralisasi di Indonesia selama dekade terakhir mencakup perubahan besar dalam paradigma dominan yang terkait dengan kegiatan belajar mengajar. Pengembangan dan penyempurnaan standar nasional, berlanjutnya perubahan dari berbasis konten menjadi kurikulum berbasis kompetensi, dan &quot;pelembagaan&quot; model pengajaran dan pembelajaran aktif berbasis siswa di bawah manajemen berbasis sekolah (MBS), semua menunjukkan pergeseran mendasar tersebut. Perkembangan ini telah menciptakan tantangan baru,&nbsp;Misalnya, banyak guru yang berusaha untuk mengadopsi kurikulum berbasis kompetensi yang relatif baru. Beranjaknya pendekatan pembelajaran dari yang biasanya berpusat pada guru, lalu pendekatan hafalan yang berubah menjadi pendekatan yang berpusat pada siswa, yang mendorong pertanyaan dan kreativitas di kelas, juga telah menantang banyak guru.

<p>Statistik dari Kemendikbud&nbsp; tahun 2011 menunjukkan bahwa sebagian besar kualifikasi guru PAUD dan tenaga kependidikan kurang &nbsp;memadai - kurang dari 16% dari guru lulusan S1 / D4, sementara sebagian besar lulusan sekolah menengah atau di bawah lulusan D2. Tenaga kependidikan dalam pendidikan pra-sekolah harus memiliki kualifikasi tertentu dalam pengasuhan anak dan pengembangan masa kanak-kanak. Orang tua harus terlibat lebih banyak pada kelompok bermain dan TK karena dapat sangat efektif dan dapat menjadi dasar untuk perkembangan.</p>

<p>Indonesia telah berpartisipasi dalam beberapa program penilaian pendidikan internasional sejak tahun 1999, yang menjadi tolok ukur prestasi siswa dan keberhasilan belajar &amp; mengajar.</p>

<p>Penurunan prestasi dalam matematika dan ilmu pengetahuan telah menjadi perhatian. Hasil Indonesia dalam Matematika dan Sains Internasional (TIMSS) tahun 2011 &lsquo;rendah&rsquo; - peringkat ke-38 dari 45 negara, dibandingkan dengan hasil tahun 2007 untuk&nbsp; anak kelas &nbsp;kedelapan. Pada International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS)&nbsp; Tahun&nbsp; 2011, ada peningkatan 12% pencapaian tingkat &nbsp;&ldquo; rendah &rdquo; untuk anak kelas empat. Indonesia berprestasi baik di bawah rata-rata ukuran OECD pada PISA. Ada perbaikan dalam matematika dan membaca, tetapi penurunan dalam sains. Di semua tes, Indonesia memiliki persentase siswa berprestasi yang sangat kecil dan sebagian besar siswa termasuk kelompok berprestasi rendah</p>

<p>Hasil PISA tidak menunjukan perbedaan yang signifikan antara hasil yang dicapai SMP yang diselelnggarakan oleh Kemenag dan Kemendikbud. Selama kunjungan, para &nbsp;guru Indonesia diminta menerapkan kurikulum baru yang dikembangkan pada 2013, yang bertujuan untuk meningkatkan kualitas pengajaran di sekolah-sekolah dan madrasah. Bantuan yang tepat diperlukan guru dan kepala sekolah dalam meningkatkan &nbsp;kualitas mengajar dan hasil belajar siswa, misalnya melalui pelatihan, metode pengajaran interaktif, dan pendekatan tematik untuk mengajar kurikulum.</p>

<p>Beberapa guru telah mengikuti pelatihan penerapan kurikulum 2013. Mereka harus betul-betul &nbsp;memahami praktek-praktek baru sebelum menerapkannya di dalam kelas sehingga mereka tidak akan merasa kewalahan. Guru dilatih, diawasi, dan dibantu di tingkat daerah, agar dapat menghadapi tantangan dalam memahami kurikulum nasional dan dalam mengadaptasi kurikulum dengan konteks lokal.</p>

<p>Relevansi pembelajaran merupakan hal penting bagi pemerataan hasil belajar karena membantu siswa dalam memahami dan menerapkan pembelajaran mereka. Sekolah yang mendapatkan &nbsp;umpan balik tertulis dari siswa lebih mungkin untuk lebih baik. Sekolah tersebut meminta umpan balik mengenai pelajaran, guru atau sumber daya, sebagai &nbsp;jaminan kualitas dan perbaikan. Mereka juga tampil lebih baik dalam penilaian PISA terbaru. Siswa yang keinginannya didengar menunjukan peningkatan prestasi dan keterlibatannya di sekolah sehingga siswa memiliki kesempatan untuk berlatih mengenai pemecahan masalah, kepemimpinan, dan berpikir kreatif yang membantu pengambilan keputusan di sekolah mereka.</p>

<p>Prestasi Indonesia dalam penilaian pendidikan internasional belum membaik. Kurikulum 2013 dikembangkan untuk menghadapi tantangan internal, eksternal, dan global. Tantangan internal adalah mewujudkan 8 standar nasional pendidikan yang berisi harapan dan ukuran dalam kaitannya dengan tingkat kompetensi kelulusan, isi kurikulum, proses belajar dan mengajar, tenaga pengajar, sarana dan prasarana, manajemen, pembiayaan pendidikan, dan penilaian pendidikan. Tantangan eksternal dan global adalah menjamin agar pendidikan memberikan keuntungan bagi anak-anak muda dalam kaitannya dengan tekanan lingkungan, kemajuan teknologi, kebutuhan untuk berkreativitas dan inovasi serta pengembangan pendidikan</p>

<p>Salah satu prinsip utama kurikulum baru adalah pergantian dari pendekatan berbasis konten ke pendekatan berbasis kompetensi dimana siswa tidak hanya menghafal konten, tetapi mampu menunjukkan kemampuan dalam melakukan sesuatu. Implementasi ini perlu dipantau untuk memastikan bahwa perubahan budaya yang nyata terjadi. Kurikulum dikembangkan untuk dilaksanakan &nbsp;di SMA umum &nbsp;dan SMA Islam (MA), yang meliputi kompetensi dasar dan pilihan. Kurikulum SMA / MA terdiri dari:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kelompok A (agama, sopan santun, kewarganegaraan, Bahasa Indonesia, matematika, sejarah, dan bahasa Inggris) dan kelompok B (seni, kesehatan dan olahraga, dan kerajinan dan kewirausahaan) mata pelajaran wajib.</li>
	<li>Kelompok &nbsp;C, yang terdiri dari mata pelajaran peminatan yaitu matematika dan ilmu pengetahuan, ilmu sosial, bahasa, dan budaya</li>
	<li>Untuk MA, di samping mata pelajaran peminatan, Kemenag juga menambahkan mata pelajaran peminatan lainnya.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kelompok A dan C dikembangkan oleh pemerintah pusat sedangkan &nbsp;B dikembangkan oleh pemerintah pusat &nbsp;dan dilaksanakan oleh pemerintah daerah.</p>

<div class=""collapsible-item-body panel-body"">
<p>Ada beberapa praktek dan model yang menggembirakan, namun, pendidikan kejuruan di tingkat SMA masih kekurangan&nbsp; referensi. Keputusan Menteri Pendidikan No.36 / 01.997 memiliki sistem pendidikan kejuruan baru yang mereformasi kurikulum di SMK agar sesuai dengan &nbsp;kebutuhan pasar tenaga kerja lokal dan fondasi yang kuat bagi siswa selama satu tahun sebelum mereka memilih bidang kejuruan tertentu. Program tersebut memperkenalkan kewirausahaan sebagai mata pelajaran tersendiri atau terintegrasi dengan mata pelajaran lainnya serta menggabungkan keterkaitannya dengan dunia usaha dan bisnis lokal, memberikan kesempatan untuk &nbsp;mendapatkan pengalaman kerja dan pengembangan keterampilan lainnya yang relevan.</p>

<p>Ada dua tantangan utama dalam menghubungkan kurikulum untuk permintaan dunia usaha. Pertama, kepala sekolah harus memiliki kompetensi keahlian dan latar belakang, dan dapat menggunakan jaringan dengan dunia usaha lokal dalam meningkatkan pengalaman belajar siswa. Kedua, hibah penting dari Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan dan Kemenag penting &nbsp;untuk menemukan cara-cara berkolaborasi dengan usaha dan juga menjamin proses belajar siswa. Solusinya mungkin menjadi pertimbangan dari kementerian dalam memberikan pelatihan khusus untuk peran kepala sekolah dan pengawas.</p>

<p>SMK dikritik karena kualitasnya dan tidak relevansinya pendidikan. Laporan dari pengusaha menyatakan bahwa banyak lulusan SMK dan politeknik tidak memiliki keterampilan yang diperlukan dalam melakukan peran dengan baik. Ia juga menyatakan bahwa pendidikan siswa di sekolah kejuruan tidak didasarkan pada kebutuhan pasar, juga tidak menyesuaikan diri dengan teknologi dan inovasi saat ini, dan kemudian diperburuk lagi dengan &nbsp;fasilitas belajar usang di beberapa penyedia keterampilan.</p>

<p>Ada beberapa alasan ketidaksesuaian ini dengan tuntutan pasar tenaga kerja. Misalnya, fakta bahwa kurikulum masih diatur oleh Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, yang tidak dikoordinasikan dengan Kementerian Perindustrian / Kementerian Tenaga Kerja dan Transmigrasi / Depnakertrans, sehingga kurikulum hanya mendapatkan sedikit masukan dari dunia usaha yang relevan. Selain itu, hanya beberapa dunia usaha yang bekerja sama dengan SMK dalam ketersediaan fasilitas dan peralatan.</p>

<p>Selain itu, jumlah guru yang ber pengalaman kerja dalam bidang khusus tidak tersedia, sehingga pendidikan mereka dianggap kurang relevan. Sering kali para guru akan kembali langsung ke sekolah dimana mereka lulus kualifikasi. Selain itu, tidak ada upaya untuk mengelola guru yang &nbsp;berkinerja buruk.</p>

<p>Berdasarkan Undang-Undang Pendidikan Tinggi, masing-masing lembaga mengembangkan kurikulum sendiri dengan mengacu pada Standar Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional untuk setiap program studi. Manajemen dan dosen harus memiliki fokus yang jelas pada pembaharuan konten dan metode di tingkat kelembagaan. Kementerian harus memberikan bantuan dan bimbingan dalam peningkatan kualifikasi mengajar di tingkat pusat. Kurikulum harus memiliki hubungan yang kuat dengan masyarakat dan dunia usaha. Pelajaran teoritis harus diberikan dan dibantu dengan pelajaran praktis dan berorientasi terhadap aplikasi.</p>

<p>Beberapa insentif yang dapat digunakan untuk mendorong dosen dan lembaga mengembangkan keterampilan mengajar baru diantaranya ialah &nbsp;skema pendanaan yang kompetitif dan pusat pengembangan mengajar di lembaga-lembaga. Sistem &nbsp;belajar mengajar yang berjalan dengan baik&nbsp; juga tergantung pada jalur dan hubungan horizontal yang fleksibel dan jelas yang memungkinkan mobilitas siswa antara program dan lembaga. Kerangka Kualifikasi Nasional (KKNI) adalah inisiatif yang diambil oleh pemerintah untuk mencapai tujuan ini.</p>

<p>Internasionalisasi pendidikan tinggi merupakan hal yang penting untuk meningkatkan kualitas. Indonesia berada di belakang, dibandingkan dengan rata-rata OECD dan beberapa negara tetangganya di Asia. Harus ada penekanan lebih pada internasionalisasi kurikulum, benchmarking internasional, akreditasi internasional, program bersama, program beasiswa, dll. &nbsp;Hal ini penting bagi mahasiswa dan staf untuk berpartisipasi dalam program-program seperti Erasmus, ASEAN University Network (AUN) demi mobilitas dan jaminan kualitas.</p>

<p>Sulit untuk mengharapkan lembaga pendidikan tinggi menjadi pusat&nbsp; penelitian karena &nbsp;banyaknya jumlah lembaga dan keterbatasan &nbsp;sumber daya. Perlu ada&nbsp; peningkatan anggaran penelitian dan pengembangan (R &amp; D). Anggaran penelitian ini harus digunakan dengan lebih terfokus, ditujukan untuk mengembangkan kualitas penelitian dan membuat program penelitian yang kuat, terutama di tujuh universitas otonom tingkat atas, kemudian pada lapis kedua, universitas pelayanan publik, dengan kriteria tambahan. Sains, teknologi, teknik, dan pertanian harus menjadi prioritas penelitian untuk mendukung tujuan dari rencana induk MP3EI. Perguruan tinggi harus kuat, terutama dalam disiplin ilmu di atas, dalam rangka untuk memainkan peran yang menentukan dalam pembangunan ekonomi. Untuk menarik dana, perguruan tinggi harus mampu menjalin kemitraan kerjasama dengan dunia usaha / industri. Perguruan tinggi harus mengembangkan pendekatan yang lebih baik berhubungan dengan dunia luar, serta membangun keahlian dan membantu fasilitas yang dibutuhkan untuk kerjasama dengan industri bisnis.</p>

<p>Ada peningkatan hasil penelitian dan makalah dalam jurnal internasional yang ditulis oleh peneliti Indonesia. Pemerintah dan perguruan tinggi harus membantu mengembangkan keahlian ini agar mendapatkan hak &nbsp;paten. Baca lebih lanjut</p>

<p>Penilaian harus memiliki standar yang jelas dan realistis. Penilaian&nbsp;juga harus dipandu oleh kurikulum dan memanfaatkan alat yang disediakan oleh sistem penilaian.</p>

<p>Permasalahan terkait dengan penilaian di Indonesia, antara lain, adalah adanya kesenjangan nyata antara kinerja siswa dan standar yang dimandatkan. Hal ini disebabkan, di antaranya, oleh tingginya jumlah kecurangan yang terjadi dalam ujian nasional. Indonesia juga dihadapkan oleh sering terjadinya perubahan dalam sistem pendidikan. Perubahan ini tidak diikuti dengan penilaian yang <em>up-to-date</em>. Standar penilaian harus menyesuaikan dengan waktu dan kebutuhan pemangku kepentingan terkait. Ketidakpastian ini menimbulkan kelemahan dalam penerapan standar tersebut. Selain itu, ada faktor yang lebih besar di Indonesia. Karena beragamnya &nbsp;pengembangan dan pendidikan, ada perdebatan panjang tentang apakah standar harus ditetapkan berbeda di seluruh negeri.</p>

<p>Namun demikian, guru masih memegang peran penting &nbsp;untuk mengetahui &nbsp;keterampilan dan kemampuan siswa. Guru harus diberikan kemampuan dalam penilaian. Selain itu, seperti yang diidentifikasi oleh Puspendik, perlu upaya untuk meningkatkan integritas dalam melawan kebiasaan kecurangan selama ujian. Ujian Nasional (UN) juga harus dipertahankan sebagai penilaian akhir yang paling dapat diandalkan untuk siswa kelas 12. Fokus &nbsp;pada mata pelajaran tertentu juga dapat menjadi pilihan strategi yang baik. Baca lebih lanjut</p>

<p>Pendidikan merupakan proses yang berkesinambungan. Karenanya pendidikan &nbsp;harus menyesuaikan dengan perubahan faktor-faktor lain, termasuk sosial, politik, ekonomi, dll. &nbsp;Untuk itu, &nbsp;seperangkat standar diperlukan. Kurikulum 13 di Indonesia (K13) merupakan satu bentuk pendidikan berbasis kompetensi, standar, dan praktik. Sayangnya, dalam pelaksanaannya masih ditemui adanya pelatihan profesi yang&nbsp; tidak merata untuk guru dan kurangnya bahan di beberapa sekolah.</p>

<p>Kurikulum merupakan sumber pengaruh. Kurikulum menjadi &nbsp;permasalahan sosial dan mempengaruhi roda perekonomian. Kurikulum juga menentukan sumber daya suatu negara. Kurikulum juga mengundang adanya perbedaan. Oleh karena itu, reformasi kurikulum harus dipertimbangkan, dimodifikasi dari waktu ke waktu, responsif terhadap perubahan kondisi, dan menjadi bagian dinamis dari sistem yang terkoordinasi untuk memantau dan meningkatkan proses belajar mengajar di setiap sekolah. Dalam K13 misalnya, Puskurbuk berupaya mengidentifikasi permasalahan dalam pelaksanaannya selain juga mempertimbangkan cara-cara untuk merevisi dan memperbaiki K13. Upaya menghadapi perbedaan dan perubahan ini penting dalam proses pengembangan kurikulum. Baca lebih lanjut</p>

<p>Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi (TIK) telah masuk ke dalam hampir semua aspek kehidupan modern.

Guru dengan kemampuan TIK menjamin siswa memiliki pengetahuan dan keterampilan yang mereka butuhkan, dan &nbsp;memiliki potensi untuk mengurangi perbedaan pendapatan dan geografis.</p>

<p>Namun demikian konektifitas masih menjadi masalah. Rumah Belajar, yang dibentuk oleh Pustekkom (Pusat Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi untuk Pendidikan), memiliki tujuan agar siswa dan guru dapat mengakses materi pembelajaran pada perangkat mobile. Namun, ukuran file materi menyebabkan permasalahan bagi mereka yang berada di daerah di mana bandwidth selulernya &nbsp;tidak kuat. Meskipun sekolah di seluruh Indonesia telah menggunakan TIK dan beberapa diantaranya memiliki perencanaan dan pendanaan untuk TIK , masih ada yang lain yang berjuang menyesuaikan diri dengan perubahan teknologi. Guru juga tidak memiliki pengetahuan dan keterampilan teknologi yang cukup.</p>

<p>Perlu ada solusi untuk masalah daya dan infrastruktur &nbsp;telekomunikasi, serta sumber-sumber energi alternatif dan solusi inovatif untuk daerah-daerah terpencil. Peningkatan konektivitas internet pasti akan membantu. Anggaran sekolah khusus untuk TIK &nbsp;juga harus disediakan, termasuk biaya TIK &nbsp;untuk infrastruktur jaringan dan perangkat digital.

<p>Indonesia telah meningkatkan kesetaraan gender dalam pendidikan sejak dekade terakhir dengan mengambil langkah-langkah lebih lanjut untuk memberikan akses yang sama pada kedua gender. Negara ini berkomitmen untuk Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) dan Tujuan Pembangunan Berkelanjutan (SDGs). MDG dan SDG mamasukan kesetaraan gender dalam pendidikan dasar dan menengah, serta pendidikan anak usia dini, teknis dan kejuruan, dan pendidikan tinggi. Kesetaraan gender di semua tingkat sistem pendidikan dan tingkat literasi untuk pemuda Indonesia&nbsp; (kelompok usia 15 - 24) telah tercapai. Gabungan antara &nbsp;kebijakan yang efektif dan investasi nasional pendidikan telah memperluas ketersediaan sekolah dengan biaya yang kecil di daerah pedesaan.</p>

<p>Namun, arah strategis untuk pengarusutamaan gender dalam pendidikan masih kurang jelas. Peningkatan &nbsp;sensitivitas staf pemerintah di daerah perlu dilakukan, karena banyak pelopor dalam bidang ini telah pensiun sementara keahlian dan &nbsp;pengetahuan mengenai kesetaraan gender tidak diregenarasi. Pelatihan guru juga belum memperlakukan wanita dan pria sama dalam pembagian tugas dan partisipasi di dalam kelas.</p>

<p>Keahlian staf pemerintah terkait gender dalam menerapkan dan mempertahankan kesetaraan gender dalam pendidikan. Pelatihan untuk anggota tim pria dan wanita diperlukan untuk memastikan semua kegiatan di seluruh sistem pendidikan sensitif terhadap gender. Guru harus memiliki program pelatihan pra-jabatan dan dalam jabatan yang komprehensif untuk guru, pengawas, dan kepala sekolah. Tinjauan kurikulum untuk memastikan tidak ada bias gender atau stereotip gender juga dapat dipertimbangkan. Baca lebih lanjut</p>

"6","1","Religious Education","<p dir=""ltr"">With the largest Muslim population in the world, Islamic education is a major part of religious education in Indonesia.&nbsp;It starts&nbsp;from <em>pesantren</em> (Islamic boarding school), a nongovernmental organization that plays&nbsp;a role not only as a provider of Islamic religious education but also a driver for community empowerment, and a center for Islamic civilization. As an educational institution, <em>pesantrens</em> have provided outstanding contributions in providing Islamic religious education services, especially in reaching out to children from disadvantaged families in rural areas.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><em>Pesantren</em> within the context of social mobility through education have produced scholars, intellectuals and elites from Islamic groups.&nbsp;Such Islamic revival is partly characterized by the emergence of a range of new ways of thinking in politics, which is to:</p>

<ol>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">review the theological foundation of political Islam,</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">redefine the ideals of political Islam, and</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">conduct a reassessment of how the ideals of political Islam can be effectively achieved.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p dir=""ltr"">By having modality for social mobility through education, <em>santris</em> or pesantren<em> </em>students (and alumni) have more opportunity to have social mobility in other fields, such as either politics, religion&nbsp;or social. In the political field, many pesantren elites have been involved in practical political activities under political parties to compete for power at particular political levels and institutions. This includes running for governor, regent/mayor or&nbsp;members of DPR and DPRD,&nbsp;or even competing for strategic positions in the ministry. In other words, social mobility occurs not only vertically but also horizontally, from <em>Ulama</em>&nbsp;(theologians) to <em>Umaro</em>&nbsp;(leaders). Within social institutions, alumni of pesantrens have also succeeded in building dynamic &quot;pressure groups&quot; as a counterweight to the government.</p>

<p>Moreover, as center for community empowerment, pesantren have also provided life skills for their santris and the surrounding community. However, this role has diminished over time as pesantrens are no longer able to keep up with technology updates. Consequently, the programs that pesantrens offer&nbsp;are no longer attractive.&nbsp;A&nbsp;growing number of santris receives the opportunity to pursue higher education,&nbsp;and the number of supporting facilities and infrastructure&nbsp;becomes limited.</p>

<p>The Islamic education system in Indonesia has similarities with education systems in other countries where Muslims are the majority population (such as Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, Turkey, Bangladesh, Afghanistan&nbsp;and Syria). Nonetheless, in Indonesia, Islamic education is legally recognized as an integral part of the national education system. Islamic education is considered to be equal with the regular education provided by the state and private educational institutions.</p>

<p>Thus, the success of Indonesia&rsquo;s 12-year compulsory education program is not only determined by the Ministry of Education and Culture but also by the Ministry of Religious Affairs. In 2015, the Central Government, through the Ministry of Religious Affairs, provided 1.7 trillion Rupiah to improve the sub-sector of Islamic education in Indonesia. This budget is focused on developing and strengthening the 12-year compulsory education program, through initiatives such as the construction of new classrooms, laboratories and other infrastructure as well as capacity building for teachers. The Strategic Plan 2015-2019 of the Ministry of Religious Affairs outlines efforts to achieve development priorities in the areas of religion and education within five years. These priorities include improving the quality and equitable access to religious education and religious-related education.</p>

<p>The Law on the Local Government, revised in 2009, gave the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) responsibility for implementation of the rules and regulations of regional autonomy. Local governments have the primary responsibility for public services in the various economic and social sectors, including education. However, activities related to religious affairs have not been decentralized and remain the full responsibility of the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Therefore, the provincial and district/city governments do not have their own religious affairs offices. Instead, the Ministry of Religious Affairs has representative offices in the provinces and districts/cities.</p>

<p><a href=""http://kelembagaan.ristekdikti.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/UU_no_20_th_2003.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Law&nbsp;20/2003 on the National Education System</a>, which emphasizes the right to education of all Indonesian citizens, also covers religious education, including the Islamic religious education provided in pesantren. Under this law, Islamic religious education institutions are considered part of the national education system of Indonesia. The number of students who attend the religious education at the primary and secondary levels has reached approximately 4,45 million children. Most of these children (4,14 million) are still at the Ula level (the equivalent to elementary school). It is important to ensure that these students continue to pursue the next level of education, which is the equivalent of secondary education, and then continue to complete 12-year compulsory education.</p>

<p>The Indonesian constitution recognizes religious pluralism and diversity. Unfortunately, acts of intolerance continue to make the news and call into question people&rsquo;s real commitment to equality in diversity. Formal Islamic education possesses an important role to promote the culture and values of tolerance and peace, but &nbsp;better implementation is still required.</p>

<p>The fight against radicalism deals with simple explanations to complex issues such as pluralism and tolerance. These are attractive explanations offered by radical organizations, which can potentially compete with Islamic education given in schools. They can enter through various community organizations with such a message offer kinship. Mass media can send the same message outside of school. One way of mitigating the influence of radical views is to employ local wisdom, if such wisdom has been helpful in facilitating tolerance amongst pluralistic communities. In North Sulawesi, for example, the motto used is &ldquo;Torang Samua Basudara&rdquo; (we are all families). Another example is Medan, which adopts a tolerant and inclusive perspective on inter-faith relationships by upholding the marga (clan).</p>

<p><a href=""http://puskurbuk.kemdikbud.go.id/"" target=""_blank"">The Center for Curriculum and Books (Puskurbuk)</a> under MoEC is responsible for the <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=30"" target=""_blank"">curriculum and textbooks</a> in Indonesia. Certain MoRA staff members were involved in developing the content for religious subjects and in writing the texts and teachers&rsquo; guides. However, involvement of MoRA was not the result of an institutional collaboration, but only collaboration on a personal basis. As a result, some dissatisfaction has been expressed with the quality and accuracy of the presentation of some religious topics in the new textbooks.</p>

<p>Expanding MoRA&rsquo;s authority to supervise unstructured extra-curricular Islamic teachings and activities conducted at the school or announced or promoted within the school can thus be useful. Enriching the curriculum of Islamic religious education used in secondary schools so that the content includes the values and culture of peace is another viable strategy. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=36"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

It integrates madrasah in the national education system in the era of decentralization. 20% of government&rsquo;s annual budgets (APBN and APBD, respectively) must be allocated to cover investment, operational and personnel costs. Specifically for basic education, the central government and local governments must guarantee the availability of funds to provide education for all citizens between the ages of seven and fifteen without collecting any fees, whether the education unit is organized by the government or the community, which includes private madrasah established by religious organizations/foundations.</p>

<p>As a first step in improving overall quality of <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=1"" target=""_blank"">basic education</a>, funding should be targeted to helping schools and madrasah, both public and private, to meet <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=43"" target=""_blank"">Minimum Service Standards (MSS)</a>. Unfortunately, the majority of private madrasah are far behind state schools/madrasah in meeting MSS. Some private madrasah also are not operating efficiently or effectively and continued government funding to these institutions should be reconsidered. In addition, funding mechanisms especially at the local level are inconsistent. In some places because the Office of Education could not (or would not) fund private madrasah, the People&#39;s Welfare Office (Kesra) located in the regional Secretariat provides support in the form of Social Donations. Although there is the desire on the part of some local governments to provide more support to private madrasah, they feel constrained by current regulations, especially those under MoHA. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=27"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>The Strategic Plan 2010-2014 of the Ministry of National Education, now the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC), gives priority to the development of the professional competencies of school and madrasah principals and supervisors to ensure improved quality in the implementation of school education programs. Principal and supervisor competencies were defined and articulated in the <a href=""http://bsnp-indonesia.org/?page_id=61"" target=""_blank"">National Education Standards (NES)</a> and <a href=""http://pmp.dikdasmen.kemdikbud.go.id/files/peraturan/permen/Permen_No_12_Tentang_Standar_Pengawas_Sekolah.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Ministerial Regulation 12/2007</a> and <a href=""http://disdik.bandung.go.id/2017/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PMD001643-13-2007.pdf"" target=""_blank"">13/2007</a>. ACDP conducted a study in 2013 to, among others, assess the level of competence of school supervisors and school principals based on the competencies in Ministerial Decrees No. 12/2007 and 13/2007 and the distribution of their competencies against agreed variables, and develop a profile of the attributes of school supervisors and school principals to inform future <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=19"" target=""_blank"">Continuous Professional Development (CPD programs)</a>.</p>

<p>An objective of the study was to determine the extent to which Ministerial Decrees No. 12/2007 and 13/2007 have been implemented by districts. Findings from the study clearly indicated that the current Principal and Supervisor standards are not fully understood by a large proportion of the individuals and groups for whom they were designed. A number of principals even said that they did not have copies of the relevant standards. Socialization of the standards was also patchy across different districts. MoRA supervisors also indicated in the quantitative surveys that they had problems in collecting information about the achievement of the NES. It was also apparent in the field study visits that a significant proportion of supervisors and principals had little understanding of the content of the NES.</p>

<p>The study identified the competency strengths and weakness of principals and supervisors at the competency dimension and competency indicator levels. The findings about the methodologies used in the INPRES training provided some important information about effective approaches to CPD Indonesia. Participants in INPRES training were generally positive about the methodologies used, especially the balance between face-to-face input, workplace application, and mentoring. In addition, there was some evidence that the training improved the competency of the principal and supervisor participants. However, there is no evidence available to determine if this is a long term effect that also leads to improvements in educational quality in schools or improvements to student learning outcomes.</p>

<p>Proposed options include developing a national education improvement program that focuses on improving the competency of principals, supervisors and teachers, as well as targeting CPD to meet the needs of specific groups of supervisors and principals using evidence from this study and future performance management/ appraisal and training needs analysis data. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=37"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

","Pendidikan Agama","<p>Dengan populasi Muslim terbesar di dunia, pendidikan agama Islam di Indonesia merupakan bagian besar dari pendidikan agama secara keseluruhan. Pendidikan Islam di Indonesia mulai melalui pesantren, organisasi non-pemerintah yang telah memainkan peran tidak hanya sebagai penyedia pendidikan agama Islam tetapi juga sebagai penggerak pengembangan masyarakat dan sebagai pusat peradaban Islam. Sebagai lembaga pendidikan, pesantren telah memberikan layanan pendidikan agama Islam yang luar biasa, terutama di daerah pedesaan di mana mereka telah menampung anak-anak dari keluarga tidak mampu.</p>

<p>Pesantren dalam konteks mobilitas sosial&nbsp; lewat pendidikan sudah menghasilkan banyak ulama, intelektual dan pemimpin kelompok-kelompok Islam.&nbsp;Kebangkitan Islam tersebut sebagian ditandai dengan munculnya berbagai pemikiran baru dalam politik yang bertujuan untuk:</p>

<ol>
	<li>meninjau landasan teologis Islam politik,</li>
	<li>mendefinisikan kembali cita-cita politik Islam, dan</li>
	<li>menilai kembali bagaimana cita-cita politik Islam dapat secara efektif dicapai.</li>
</ol>

<p>Akses yang lebih besar terhadap pendidikan memberikan lebih banyak kesempatan kepada siswa pesantren (santri) dan alumni untuk merasakan&nbsp; mobilitas sosial di bidang-bidang seperti politik, agama dan jaringan sosial. Dalam politik, banyak lulusan pesantren memiliki posisi di partai politik yang telah berkompetisi untuk kekuasaan di berbagai tingkatan politik dan lembaga. Misalnya, mereka mengisi posisi sebagai gubernur, bupati/walikota dan untuk posisi sebagai anggota DPR dan DPRD. Mereka bahkan ikut bersaing untuk posisi strategis di Kementerian. Mobilitas sosial tidak hanya terjadi secara vertikal, tetapi juga horizontal, dan banyak ahli teologi (Ulama) telah menjadi pemimpin (umaro). Dalam agama, lulusan pesantren telah berhasil naik ke posisi &quot;Dai&quot; dan mengubahnya menjadi salah satu yang lebih terhormat dan memiliki penghasilan yang layak. Dengan menggunakan jaringan sosial, alumni pesantren telah berhasil membangun &quot;pressure groups&quot; yang dinamis berperan sebagai penyeimbang pemerintah.</p>

<p>Selain itu, sebagai pusat pemberdayaan masyarakat, pesantren juga memberikan keterampilan hidup untuk santri dan masyarakat sekitar. Namun, peran ini telah berkurang dari waktu ke waktu karena pesantren tidak lagi mampu menyesuaikan diri &nbsp;dengan perkembangan teknologi. Akibatnya, program, yang menawarkan pesantren, tidak lagi menarik; semakin banyak santri mengambil kesempatan untuk mengejar pendidikan tinggi; sehingga jumlah sarana dan prasarana pendukung menjadi terbatas.</p>

<p>Sistem pendidikan Islam di Indonesia memiliki ciri yang mirip dengan sistem pendidikan di negara-negara lain di mana umat Islam merupakan penduduk mayoritas (seperti Mesir, Nigeria, Pakistan, Turki, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, dan Suriah). Namun tidak seperti banyak negara lain,&nbsp; Indonesia secara resmi mengakui pendidikan Islam sebagai bagian integral dari sistem pendidikan nasional. Di Indonesia, pendidikan Islam dianggap setara dengan pendidikan umum yang diselenggarakan oleh lembaga pendidikan pemerintah dan swasta.</p>

<p>Dengan demikian, keberhasilan Program wajib belajar 12 - tahun di Indonesia tidak hanya ditentukan oleh Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan tetapi juga oleh Kementerian Agama. Pada tahun 2015, Pemerintah Pusat, melalui Kementerian Agama, menyediakan sekitar &nbsp;1,7 triliun Rupiah untuk meningkatkan sub-sektor pendidikan Islam di Indonesia. Anggaran ini difokuskan pada pengembangan dan penguatan program wajib belajar 12 tahun, melalui inisiatif seperti pembangunan ruang kelas baru, laboratorium dan infrastruktur lainnya serta peningkatan kapasitas para guru. Rencana Strategis 2015-2019 dari Kementerian Agama menguraikan upaya untuk mewujudkan prioritas pembangunan di bidang agama dan pendidikan dalam waktu lima tahun. Prioritas ini termasuk meningkatkan kualitas dan pemerataan akses pendidikan agama dan pendidikan keagamaan terkait.</p>

<p>UU Pemerintah Daerah, yang pertama kali diterbitkan pada tahun 1999 (kemudian direvisi pada tahun 2009), memberikan tanggung jawab Kementerian Dalam Negeri (Kemendagri) untuk pelaksanaan aturan dan peraturan otonomi daerah. Pemerintah daerah memiliki tanggung jawab utama untuk pelayanan publik di berbagai sektor ekonomi dan sosial, termasuk pendidikan. Namun, kegiatan yang berkaitan dengan urusan agama belum didesentralisasikan dan tetap menjadi tanggung jawab penuh dari Kementerian Agama. Oleh karena itu, pemerintah provinsi dan kabupaten/kota tidak memiliki kantor urusan agama mereka sendiri. Tetapi, Departemen Agama memiliki kantor perwakilan di provinsi dan kabupaten / kota.</p>

<p>Undang-Undang Nomor 20/2003 tentang Sistem Pendidikan Nasional, yang menjelaskan hak atas pendidikan untuk semua warga negara Indonesia, juga mencakup pendidikan agama, termasuk pendidikan agama Islam yang disediakan di pesantren. Menurut UU ini, lembaga-lembaga pendidikan agama Islam dianggap sebagai bagian dari sistem pendidikan nasional Indonesia. Jumlah siswa yang mengikuti pendidikan agama di tingkat dasar dan menengah telah mencapai sekitar 4,45 juta anak. Sebagian besar anak-anak ini (4,14 juta) masih pada tingkat Ula (setara dengan sekolah dasar). UU ini penting untuk memastikan agar siswa tersebut terus melanjutkan ke tingkat pendidikan berikutnya, yang setara dengan pendidikan menengah, dan kemudian melanjutkan untuk menyelesaikan pendidikan wajib belajar 12 tahun.</p>

<p>Konstitusi Indonesia mengakui pluralisme dan keberagaman dalam agama. Sayangnya, tindakan intoleransi terus menjadi berita dan mempertanyakan komitmen nyata masyarakat terhadap kesetaraan dalam keberagaman. Pendidikan Islam formal memiliki peran penting untuk mempromosikan budaya dan nilai-nilai toleransi serta perdamaian, tetapi masih diperlukan implementasi yang lebih baik.</p>

<p>Perang melawan radikalisme dilakukan dnegna &nbsp;penjelasan sederhana untuk masalah kompleks seperti pluralisme dan toleransi. Penjelasan yang &nbsp;menarik disampaikan oleh organisasi radikal, yang berpotensi menyaingi pendidikan Islam yang diberikan di sekolah-sekolah. Mereka bisa masuk melalui berbagai organisasi masyarakat dengan menggunakan pendekatan kekerabatan. Media massa dapat mengirim pesan yang sama di luar sekolah. Salah satu cara untuk mengurangi pengaruh radikalisme adalah dengan menggunakan kearifan lokal, dan kearifan seperti ini &nbsp;telah membantu memfasilitasi toleransi di antara masyarakat pluralistik. Di Sulawesi Utara, misalnya, moto yang digunakan adalah &ldquo; Torang Samua Basudara &rdquo; ( kita semua keluarga). Contoh lain adalah Medan, yang mengadopsi perspektif toleran dan inklusif antara yang berbeda agama dengan menjunjung tinggi marga (clan).</p>

<p>Pusat Kurikulum dan Buku (PusKurBuk) di bawah Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan bertanggung jawab untuk kurikulum dan buku teks di Indonesia. Anggota staf Kemenag &nbsp;dilibatkan dalam pengembangan konten untuk mata pelajaran agama dan dalam menulis teks dan panduan guru . Namun, keterlibatan Kemenag &nbsp;bukanlah hasil dari kolaborasi kelembagaan, tetapi hanya kolaborasi secara pribadi. Akibatnya, beberapa ketidakpuasan muncul terkait kualitas dan akurasi penyajian beberapa topik agama di buku-buku pelajaran baru.</p>

<p>Menambah kewenangan Kemenag &nbsp;&nbsp;untuk mengawasi &nbsp;pengajaran Islam dalam kegiata kurikuler dan kegiatan lain yang dilakukan di sekolah atau diumumkan atau dipromosikan di sekolah agar dapat bermanfaat. Memperkaya kurikulum pendidikan agama Islam yang digunakan di sekolah menengah agar konten termasuk nilai-nilai dan budaya damai adalah strategi lain yang dapat dipertimbangkan. Baca lebih lanjut</p>

<p>UU No. 20/2003 menetapkan bahwa pendanaan untuk pendidikan merupakan tanggung jawab bersama antara pemerintah pusat, pemerintah daerah, dan masyarakat. UU ini juga mengintegrasikan madrasah dalam sistem pendidikan nasional di era desentralisasi. 20% dari anggaran tahunan pemerintah (masing-masing APBN dan APBD,) harus dialokasikan untuk menutupi biaya investasi, operasional dan pegawai. Khusus untuk pendidikan dasar, pemerintah pusat dan pemerintah daerah harus menjamin ketersediaan dana untuk menyediakan pendidikan bagi semua warga negara berusia antara tujuh hingga lima belas tahun tanpa memungut biaya apapun, apakah satuan pendidikan yang diselenggarakan oleh pemerintah atau masyarakat, seperti madrasah swasta yang didirikan oleh organisasi/yayasan keagamaan.</p>

<p>Sebagai langkah pertama dalam meningkatkan kualitas pendidikan dasar secara keseluruhan, dana harus ditargetkan untuk membantu sekolah-sekolah dan madrasah, baik negeri maupun swasta, untuk memenuhi Standar Pelayanan Minimum (SPM). Sayangnya, sebagian besar madrasah swasta jauh di belakang sekolah negeri / madrasah dalam memenuhi SPM. Beberapa madrasah swasta juga tidak berjalan secara efisien atau efektif dan pendanaan pemerintah terhadap lembaga tersebut harus dipertimbangkan kembali. Selain itu, mekanisme pendanaan terutama di tingkat lokal tidak konsisten. Di beberapa tempat karena Dinas Pendidikan tidak bisa (atau tidak dapat) mendanai madrasah swasta, Dinas Kesejahteraan Rakyat (Kesra) yang ada di Sekretariat daerah memberikan bantuan dalam bentuk Sumbangan Sosial. Meskipun ada keinginan beberapa pemerintah daerah untuk memberikan bantuan lebih banyak untuk madrasah swasta, mereka merasa dibatasi oleh peraturan saat ini, terutama mereka yang berada di bawah Kemendagri.

<p>Rencana Strategis tahun 2010-2014 dari Kementerian Pendidikan Nasional, sekarang Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan (Kemendikbud), memberikan prioritas pengembangan kompetensi profesional Kepala Sekolah dan Pengawas&nbsp; &nbsp;dan madrasah untuk memastikan peningkatan kualitas dalam pelaksanaan program pendidikan sekolah. Kompetensi Kepala Sekolah dan pengawas didefinisikan dan diartikulasikan dalam Standar Nasional Pendidikan &nbsp;(SNP ) dan Keputusan Menteri nomor 12/2007 dan 13/2007. ACDP melakukan penelitian pada tahun 2013, antara lain, menilai tingkat kompetensi pengawas dan kepala sekolah berdasarkan kompetensi pada Keputusan Menteri No. 12/2007 dan 13/2007 dan penyebaran kompetensi mereka terhadap variabel yang disetujui dan menyebarkan &nbsp;profil tanggung jawab pengawas sekolah dan kepala sekolah dalam menginformasikan program PKB mendatang.</p>

<p>Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk menentukan sejauh mana Keputusan Menteri No. 12/2007 dan 13/2007 telah dilaksanakan oleh kabupaten. Temuan penelitian menunjukkan bahwa standar Kepala Sekolah dan Pengawas saat ini tidak sepenuhnya dipahami oleh sebagian besar individu dan kelompok untuk siapa standar itu dirancang. Sejumlah kepala sekolah bahkan mengatakan bahwa mereka tidak memiliki salinan tentang standar yang dimaksud. Sosialisasi standar juga tambal sulam di kabupaten yang berbeda. Supervisor Kemendag &nbsp;juga mengungkapkan dalam survei kuantitatif bahwa mereka kesulitan dalam mengumpulkan informasi mengenai pencapaian SNP . Hal ini juga terlihat &nbsp;saat kunjungan studi lapangan dimana masih banyak pengawas dan kepala sekolah yang memiliki sedikit pemahaman tentang isi dari SNP .</p>

<p>Penelitian ini mengidentifikasi kekuatan dan kelemahan kompetensi kepala sekolah dan pengawas pada tingkat dimensi kompetensi dan indikator kompetensi. Temuan tentang metodologi yang digunakan dalam pelatihan INPRES memberikan beberapa informasi penting tentang pendekatan yang efektif untuk PKB Indonesia. Peserta pelatihan INPRES umumnya positif dengan metodologi yang digunakan, terutama keseimbangan antara tatap muka, penerapan di tempat kerja, dan mentoring. Selain itu, ada bukti bahwa pelatihan meningkatkan kompetensi kepala sekolah dan pengawas sebagai peserta. Namun demikian, tidak ada bukti yang tersedia untuk menentukan apakah ada efek jangka panjang yang mendorong adanya perbaikan kualitas pendidikan di sekolah-sekolah atau perbaikan hasil belajar siswa.</p>

<p>Opsi yang diajukan diantaranya ialah pengembangan program peningkatan pendidikan nasional yang berfokus pada peningkatan kompetensi kepala sekolah, pengawas dan guru, serta mengupayakan agar PKB dapat memenuhi kebutuhan pengawas dan kepala sekolah memanfaatkan bukti yang didapat dari penelitian dan manajemen kinerja / penilaian dan data analisis kebutuhan pelatihan.

Unfortunately, Indonesia has a difficulty in providing high quality teachers across the country. <a href=""http://humas.unimed.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Undang-Undang-Nomor-14-Tahun-2005.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Law 14/2005 on Teachers and Lecturers</a> positions teaching as a profession. It strives to&nbsp;drive&nbsp;teachers&rsquo; pay up to be on par with that of law and medical professions. It requires teachers to hold an academic bachelor&rsquo;s degree and successfully achieve certification. The law has also been a strong push for teachers to upgrade their qualifications. Undoubtedly however, issues persist, including the distribution of teachers and teacher absenteeism. Many of these issues can certainly not be separated from that of the school&rsquo;s leadership.</p>

<p>A fair distribution of qualified teachers is a complex issue in Indonesia&rsquo;s educational system where private schools play an important role in educational provision, specifically in <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=3"" target=""_blank"">remote and rural areas</a>. In the past, most formal education was provided primarily by private faith-based organizations. Recognizing the importance of private provision in Indonesia&rsquo;s education system, the Government has sought to balance the quality of private and public education through several policy actions, including the BOS and placing PNS teachers in private schools. These PNS teachers are called &ldquo;guru PNS yang dipekerjakan&rdquo; (DPK teachers), DPK teachers make up half of the teachers. The proportion of PNS and non-PNS teachers in public and private schools varies by district. In the Sumba districts overall, 45% of teachers in government schools are PNS and 40% of teachers in private schools are PNS.</p>

<p>The issues are the withdrawal of DPK teachers by the government of Pekalongan district in Central Java, which was an action that received harsh criticism from the Forum for Private Education Institutions (Badan Musyawarah Perguruan Swasta or BMPS); re-deploying DPK teachers to government schools will adversely affect the 3T areas (predominantly outermost, isolated, underdeveloped areas), as may be demonstrated by the case of Central Sumba where the mandate would translate to the district losing half of the teachers in their private schools; there are inconsistencies in policies emanating from different levels in the hierarchy of legal products: government regulations or Peraturan Pemerintah, Laws or Undang-Undang, and Ministerial Decrees or Peraturan Menteri. This gives the impression that ministries are pulling in different directions on the issue. It has created confusion at the district level that is exacerbated by rumors, misinterpretation of public statements, and a tendency to take public statements as new regulations, etc.</p>

<p>The proposed options include a need for clarity on the placement of PNS teachers in private schools at the policy, legal, and regulatory levels. More importantly, there is a need for careful consideration regarding how the legal and regulatory framework pertaining to PNS teacher management and distribution will be interpreted at the local level. The risk is that rigid application of overall PNS management policies to DPK teachers will doubly put children in rural remote areas in a disadvantage. Those children are already disadvantaged simply by residing in resource poor areas. To withdraw qualified teachers from their schools would further deprive them of one resource that could help them to improve their lives now and in the future. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=16"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>There are two different forms of absence:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Teacher absence from school: defined as the number of teachers who were not at school (for whatever reason). This is expressed as a proportion of all teachers who were scheduled to be teaching; and</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Teacher absence from class: defined as the number of teachers who, although present at school, were not in the classroom. This is expressed as a proportion of all teachers who were scheduled to be teaching.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Substantial body of research has found that teachers are one of the most important in-school factors in improving student learning. High rates of teacher absence would affect the students, other teachers and operations of schools. For instance, unattended classes are considerably more likely to leave students without a prescribed activity. The student absence rate is also higher in schools with a high teacher absence rate.</p>

<p>Teacher absenteeism rate in Indonesia has decreased from 19% in 2003 to 10% in 2013, and the 2013 estimate is generally lower than the estimate in few other developing countries. However, it is still considered high. Among different regions, types of teachers and types of schools, teacher absence rates vary widely. Teacher absence rates were found to be generally higher among male teachers, among teachers who worked at more than one school, in remote schools and&nbsp;in schools with poor physical facilities, to name a few.</p>

<p>The most common reason for absence was due to official teaching-related duties, such as meetings and trainings. Furthermore, only one in four teachers who were absent from class were found engaged in another academic activity, such as designing teaching materials or assessing students&rsquo; work.</p>

<p>At the national level, policy priorities include reconsidering the current national policies on teachers&rsquo; working hours, so as to reduce the incentive for teachers to work at more than one school, and expanding the current standards concerning the expectations of teachers to include their non-teaching time and responsibilities. At the district level, policy priorities include strengthening support and supervision of the teaching and learning process and increasing the focus on supporting schools in recording and tracking absence levels. At the school level, policy priorities include strengthening principal selection and competency development as a key to promoting a &ldquo;presence and engagement culture&rdquo; among teachers and providing schools with clear policies and support for managing teacher absences and substitute teachers in ways that minimize the impact on students. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=20"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p><strong><u>Principals</u></strong></p>

<p>Exemplary school principals are an important factor in improving school effectiveness and enhancing quality. Indonesia&rsquo;s <a href=""http://disdik.semarangkota.go.id/rapbs2012/uploads/Kepmendiknas-2002-U-044-Dewan_Pendidikan_dan_Komite_Sekolah.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Ministerial Decree 44/2002</a> mandated school-based management, making the principal the key decision maker. These include <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=27"" target=""_blank"">finance and budgeting</a>, staff management, school planning, and <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=30"" target=""_blank"">curriculum</a> development roles. It thus requires principals to have upgraded skills. Principals Preparation Program (PPP) is conducted to ensure those eligible to become principals are ready for the job.</p>

<p>Two aspects of PPP considered effective are Nomor Unik Kepala Sekolah (NUKS), an official principal registration number, and PPP mentoring program. Some issues persist, including the fact that principals are applying the administrative requirements and education policy routinely, but not the skills and knowledge of instructional leaders.&nbsp; Also, in terms of PPP, unfortunately, the degree of political and bureaucratic involvement in identifying applicants into PPP and in the appointment of school principals was a problem. An option worth considering is to have LPPKS be more diligent about the Master Trainers&rsquo; attendance and performance. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=17"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p><strong><u>School Supervisors</u></strong></p>

<p>School supervisors are expected to act as both education managers and &lsquo;leaders of learning&rsquo;. They need to ensure application of education standards such as 1) inspecting and evaluating, and 2) advising, assisting, and supporting teachers and school leadership. The globally continuing debate is whether school supervisors should focus one or the other. <a href=""http://bkd.pemkomedan.go.id/download/peraturan/Pengembangan%20Karir/JABATAN%20FUNGSIONAL/pengawas%20sekolah/Permenpan%20dan%20RB%20No.21%20tahun%202010%20tentang%20Jabfung%20Pengawas%20Sekolah%20dan%20Angka%20Kreditnya.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Ministerial Regulation of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform Regulation 21/2010</a> describes the supervisor as a &ldquo;civil servant...responsible&hellip;to conduct academic and managerial supervision on education units&rdquo;. School supervisors are required to meet <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=43"" target=""_blank"">Minimum Service Standards (MSS)</a>, and the competencies required of school supervisors are further defined in <a href=""http://pmp.dikdasmen.kemdikbud.go.id/files/peraturan/permen/Permen_No_12_Tentang_Standar_Pengawas_Sekolah.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Ministerial Decree 12/2007</a>. Ministerial Regulation 21/2010 also outlines the main tasks of supervisors, which include monitoring the implementation of Indonesia&rsquo;s eight National Education Standards, among others.</p>

<p>The key challenge suggested by many publications on school supervision in Indonesia is the recruitment process. Some suggested that supervisors should have experience in school leadership positions. Issues in terms of supervisors include the fact that they are generally rated high in &ldquo;Social&rdquo; and &ldquo;Personality&rdquo; dimensions of competencies and low in &ldquo;Research&rdquo; and &ldquo;Academic Supervision&rdquo;, with considerable variation between regions. A significant proportion of supervisors also had little understanding about the content of National Education Standards or how such standards could be used to benefit schools and student learning. An option worth considering is In lieu of Ministerial Regulation 21/2010&rsquo;s requirement for supervisor positions to be held only by teachers with civil servant status, some have suggested for supervisors to have prior school leadership experience. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=18"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>Indonesia is currently reforming its national education system, presenting the opportunity to promote the development of 21st century skills to compete with other countries (particularly in the ASEAN region). In order to effectively teach those skills, teachers must be equipped with a rich repertoire/plan in learning strategies, an inÃ¢â‚¬Âdepth understanding on how learning is delivered, an ability to work collaboratively, strong technology skills, and the ability to use technology as tools to enhance learning.</p>

<p>Teacher Working Groups (Primary School Teacher Cluster or Kelompok Kerja Guru/KKG) and Secondary School Subject Teacher Cluster or Musyawarah Guru Mata Pelajaran/MGMP) has been recognized as the most appropriate and effective path which most teachers can take in receiving CPD. It provides a forum for teachers to discuss and work together in developing curriculum, lesson plans, teaching practice and other issues including teaching students with special needs or teaching students using their mother tongue. An alternative form that has a similar strategy to KKGs and MGMPs is called the &ldquo;Smart Teacher&rdquo; online platform (Guru Pintar Online/GPO) which is managed by Indonesia&rsquo;s Open University (Universitas Terbuka/UT). GPO is an online forum or media, which opens the opportunities for teachers to help one another by sharing best practices and materials beyond their local teacher working groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The issues are: (i) CPD in Indonesia still require significant improvement. A review by OECD reveals that many teachers do not receive any CPD and, moreover, receive little professional guidance by external facilitators, principals, supervisors, or even mentoring by experienced teachers, (ii) in Indonesia the current teaching working groups are yet to be considered as providing the expected results because KKGs and MGMPs still have many issues and problems. The proposed options to these issues include, but are not limited to, providing CPD programs related to the teacher qualification process;&nbsp; teacher working groups such as KKGs/MGMPs would provide better outcomes if they&nbsp; help teachers focus on providing more effective learning for students, use evidenceÃ¢â‚¬Âbased reviews from research and data on student learning outcomes, support teachers to review and adapt their teaching practice according to its impact on student learning, etc.; <a href=""http://www.mebermutu.org/media.php?module=home"" target=""_blank"">BERMUTU</a>, a program which also aims to improve the curriculum used in teacher working groups. The program recommended the use of a more coherent program based on the principles of Lesson Study, which is a variant of the Classroom Action Research approach and is being adopted extensively internationally; etc. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=19"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

","Guru dan Kepemimpinan Pendidikan","<p>Guru merupakan kunci untuk pendidikan berkualitas. Sayangnya, Indonesia memiliki kesulitan dalam menyediakan guru yang berkualitas tinggi di seluruh negeri. UU Guru dan Dosen (UU No.14 2005) menempatkan mengajar sebagai profesi, sehingga guru mendapatkan bayaran &nbsp;menjadi setara dengan profesi hukum dan medis. UU mengharuskan guru untuk memiliki gelar sarjana pendidikan dan tersertifikasi dan sangat mendorong guru untuk meningkatkan kualifikasi mereka. Meskipun demikian, masalah tetap ada, termasuk dalam penyebaran dan ketidakhadiran guru. Masalah mengenai guru tentunya tidak dapat dipisahkan dari kepemimpinan sekolah.</p>

<p>Penyebaran guru &nbsp;yang berkualitas secara merata &nbsp;merupakan masalah yang kompleks pada sistem pendidikan di Indonesia di mana sekolah swasta memainkan peran penting dalam penyediaan pendidikan, khususnya di daerah pedesaan terpencil. Di masa lalu, sebagian besar pendidikan formal diberikan terutama oleh organisasi swasta berbasis keagamaan. Mengingat pentingnya penyediaan sistem pendidikan swasta di Indonesia, Pemerintah berupaya untuk menyeimbangkan kualitas pendidikan swasta dan negeri melalui beberapa langkah kebijakan, termasuk BOS dan menempatkan guru PNS di sekolah swasta. Guru-guru PNS ini disebut &ldquo; guru PNS Yang dipekerjakan &rdquo; ( DPK guru), guru DPK berjumlah setengah dari guru. Proporsi PNS dan non - guru PNS di sekolah negeri dan swasta bervariasi tiap kabupaten. Di kabupaten Sumba keseluruhan, 45% guru di sekolah-sekolah pemerintah berstatus &nbsp;PNS dan 40% guru di sekolah swasta adalah PNS.</p>

<p>Permasalahannya adalah penarikan guru DPK oleh pemerintah kabupaten Pekalongan Jawa Tengah, tindakan yang mendapat kritik keras dari Badan Musyawarah Perguruan Swasta atau BMPS; menempatkan kembali &nbsp;guru DPK ke sekolah-sekolah negeri akan mempengaruhi daerah 3T (terutama daerah terluar, terpencil, tertinggal), sebagaimana ditunjukkan dalam kasus Sumba Tengah di mana kewajiban yang diterapkan di kabupaten menyebabkan kehilangan setengah dari guru di sekolah swasta; ada inkonsistensi dalam kebijakan yang berasal di tingkat yang berbeda dalam hirarki produk hukum: Peraturan Pemerintah, Undang-Undang, dan Peraturan Menteri. Hal ini menunjukan kesan bahwa kementerian memiliki arah yang berbeda pada masalah ini. Hal ini juga telah menciptakan kebingungan di tingkat kabupaten yang diperburuk oleh rumor, salah menafsirkan pernyataan publik, dan kecenderungan mengambil pernyataan publik sebagai peraturan baru, dll.</p>

<p>Pilihan yang diusulkan meliputi kebutuhan kejelasan, hukum, dan tingkat regulasi untuk kebijakan penempatan guru PNS di sekolah swasta. Lebih penting lagi, ada kebutuhan untuk melihat bagaimana kerangka hukum dan peraturan yang berkaitan dengan manajemen dan distribusi guru PNS akan diinterpretasikan di tingkat lokal. Risiko penerapan kebijakan manajemen PNS yang kaku tentang guru DPK menempatkan anak-anak di daerah terpencil pedesaan di posisi yang kurang menguntungkan. Anak-anak dirugikan hanya karena berada di daerah miskin sumber daya. Menarik guru berkualitas dari sekolah mereka akan lebih menjauhkan mereka dari sumber daya yang dapat membantu mereka memperbaiki kehidupan mereka sekarang dan &nbsp;di masa depan.

<p>Ada dua bentuk ketidakhadiran:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Guru bolos dari sekolah: adalah sejumlah guru yang tidak di sekolah (karena berbagai alasan). Hal ini dinyatakan sebagai proporsi semua guru yang dijadwalkan akan mengajar; dan</li>
	<li>Guru absen dari kelas: adalah sejumlah guru yang, meskipun hadir di sekolah, tapi tidak di dalam kelas. Hal ini dinyatakan sebagai proporsi semua guru yang dijadwalkan akan mengajar.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sejumlah penelitian menemukan bahwa guru merupakan salah satu faktor paling penting dalam sekolah untuk meningkatkan pembelajaran siswa. Tingginya tingkat ketidakhadiran guru akan mempengaruhi siswa, guru lain dan operasi sekolah. Misalnya, kelas tanpa pengawasan jauh lebih mungkin untuk meninggalkan siswa tanpa tugas. Tingkat ketidakhadiran siswa juga lebih tinggi di sekolah-sekolah dengan tingkat ketidakhadiran guru yang tinggi.</p>

<p>Tingkat ketidakhadiran guru di Indonesia mengalami penurunan dari 19% pada tahun 2003 menjadi 10% di 2013, dan 2013 diperkirakan lebih rendah dari&nbsp; beberapa negara berkembang lainnya. Namun, masih dianggap tinggi. Di antara berbagai daerah, jenis guru dan jenis sekolah, tingkat ketidakhadiran guru bervariasi. Tingkat ketidakhadiran guru ditemukan lebih tinggi di antara guru laki-laki, di antaranya ialah para guru yang bekerja di lebih dari satu sekolah, di sekolah-sekolah terpencil, di sekolah-sekolah dengan fasilitas fisik yang buruk..</p>

<p>Alasan paling umum untuk ketidakhadiran disebabkan karena tugas resmi berkaitan dengan pembelajaran, seperti rapat dan pelatihan. Selain itu, hanya satu dari empat guru yang absen dari kelas karena terlibat dalam kegiatan akademik lain, seperti pembuatan bahan ajar atau menilai kinerja siswa.</p>

<p>Di tingkat nasional, prioritas kebijakannya ialah mempertimbangkan kembali kebijakan nasional mengenai jam kerja guru, sehingga dapat mengurangi insentif guru yang bekerja di lebih dari satu sekolah, dan memperluas standar saat ini mengenai harapan guru untuk menyertakan waktu di luar &nbsp;mengajar dan tanggung jawabnya. Di tingkat kabupaten, prioritas kebijakannya ialah penguatan dukungan dan pengawasan pada proses pengajaran dan pembelajaran dan meningkatkan fokus dukungan untuk sekolah dalam merekam dan melacak tingkat ketidakhadiran. Di tingkat sekolah, prioritas kebijakannya ialah penguatan pemilihan dan pengembangan kompetensi kepala sekolah sebagai kunci untuk mempromosikan &ldquo;budaya kehadiran dan keterlibatan&rdquo; antara guru dan menyediakan kebijakan dan dukungan yang jelas untuk mengelola absensi guru dan guru pengganti agar dampak pada siswa minimal.

<p>Kepala sekolah teladan merupakan faktor penting dalam meningkatkan efektivitas dan peningkatan mutu&nbsp; sekolah. Peraturan Menteri Indonesia&nbsp; nomor 44/2002 mengeluarkan tentang manajemen&nbsp; berbasis sekolah, yang menempatkan kepala sekolah sebagai pembuat keputusan utama&nbsp; misalnya dalam urusan keuangan dan penganggaran, manajemen staf, perencanaan sekolah, dan peran pengembangan kurikulum. Karenanya kepala sekolah harus senantiasa meningkatkan keterampilannya. Program Persiapan Kepala Sekolah (PPKS) diadakan untuk memastikan mereka yang memenuhi syarat menjadi kepala sekolah adalah yang siap untuk pekerjaan itu.</p>

<p>Dua aspek PPKS yang dianggap penting yaitu Nomor Unik Kepala Sekolah (NUKS), sebuah nomor resmi pendaftaran kepala sekolah, dan program mentoring PPKS. Beberapa masalah tetap ada misalnya fakta bahwa ada kepala sekolah yang memenuhi ketentuan administrasi dan kebijakan pendidikan, tetapi tidak memenuhi keterampilan dan pengetahuan sebagai pemimpin&nbsp; pendidikan. Selain itu,&nbsp; sayangnya adanya kepentingan&nbsp; politik dan birokrasi dalam penentuan calon yang ikut serta dalam PPKS dan dalam&nbsp; pengangkatan kepala sekolah. Pilihan kebijakannya adalah mendorong agar kehadiran dan kinerja Master Trainer LPPKS lebih ditingkatkan. Baca lebih lanjut</p>

<p><u>Pengawas sekolah</u></p>

<p>Pengawas sekolah diharapkan untuk bertindak sebagai manajer pendidikan dan &#39; pemimpin belajar &#39; .&nbsp; Mereka harus memastikan penerapan standar pendidikan seperti 1) memeriksa dan mengevaluasi, dan 2) menasihati, membantu, dan mendukung guru dan kepemimpinan sekolah. Perdebatan global terus adalah apakah pengawas sekolah harus fokus satu atau yang lain. Peraturan Menteri Pendayagunaan Aparatur Negara dan Birokrasi nomor&nbsp; 21 tahun 2010 menjelaskan bahwa pengawas adalah &ldquo; PNS ... bertanggung jawab ... untuk melakukan pengawasan akademik dan manajerial pada satuan pendidikan&rdquo;. Pengawas sekolah harus memenuhi Standar Pelayanan Minimum (SPM), dan kompetensi yang dibutuhkan pengawas sekolah ditetapkan lebih lanjut dalam Keputusan Menteri 12/2007. Peraturan Menteri Nomor 21 Tahun 2010 juga menguraikan tugas utama supervisor, diantaranya ialah melaksanakan&nbsp; monitoring&nbsp; terhadap delapan Standar Nasional Pendidikan Indonesia.</p>

<p>Permasalahan utama yang banyak disebut&nbsp; dalam berbagai publikasi mengenai pengawasan sekolah di Indonesia adalah proses perekrutan. Beberapa menyarankan bahwa pengawas harus memiliki pengalaman di posisi kepemimpinan sekolah. Permasalahan lain terkait pengawas yaitu adanya fakta bahwa pengawas biasanya dinilai&nbsp; tinggi dalam dimensi&nbsp; kompetensi&nbsp; &ldquo;Sosial &rdquo; dan &ldquo; Pribadi &rdquo; dan rendah&nbsp; dalam dimensi&nbsp; &ldquo; Penelitian &rdquo; dan &ldquo; Pengawasan Akademik &rdquo; , dengan variasi yang cukup besar antar daerah. Sebagian besar pengawas juga memiliki sedikit pemahaman tentang isi dari Standar Nasional Pendidikan atau bagaimana standar tersebut dapat digunakan untuk kepentingan sekolah dan belajar siswa. Pilihan yang layak dipertimbangkan adalah Sebagai pengganti dari Peraturan Menteri 21 tahun 2010 mengenai&nbsp; persyaratan jabatan pengawas yang hanya untuk guru dengan status PNS, beberapa menyarankan agar pengawas memiliki pengalaman memimpin sekolah sebelumnya.

<p>Indonesia saat ini sedang mereformasi sistem pendidikan nasional, menyajikan kesempatan untuk pengembangan keterampilan abad ke-21 untuk bersaing dengan negara-negara lain (khususnya di kawasan ASEAN). Agar efektif mengajarkan keterampilan tersebut, guru harus dilengkapi dengan perbendaharaan/rencana dalam strategi pembelajaran, pemahaman mendalam tentang penyampaian pembelajaran, kemampuan bekerja sama, keterampilan teknologi yang kuat, dan kemampuan menggunakan teknologi sebagai alat untuk meningkatkan pembelajaran.</p>

<p>Kelompok guru Kerja (Kelompok Kerja Guru / KKG untuk tingkat SD) dan Musyawarah Guru Mata Pelajaran / MGMP untuk sekolah menengah telah diakui sebagai cara paling tepat dan efektif bagi guru untuk menerima PKB. PKB menjadi forum bagi guru untuk berdiskusi dan bekerja sama dalam mengembangkan kurikulum, rencana pelajaran, praktek mengajar dan isu-isu lainnya termasuk mengajar siswa berkebutuhan khusus atau mengajar siswa menggunakan bahasa ibu. Bentuk alternatif strategi yang sama untuk KKG dan MGMP disebut &ldquo;Guru Pintar &rdquo; online/GPO) yang dikelola oleh Universitas Terbuka / UT). GPO adalah sebuah forum atau media online, yang membuka peluang bagi guru untuk membantu satu sama lain dengan cara berbagi praktik terbaik dan bahan dengan kelompok guru di luar daerah mereka.</p>

<p>Permasalahannya adalah: (i) PKB di Indonesia masih memerlukan perbaikan yang signifikan. Hasil review OECD mengungkapkan bahwa banyak guru tidak mengikuti PKB dan, bahkan, sedikit mendapatkan bimbingan profesional dari fasilitator eksternal, kepala sekolah, pengawas, atau bahkan pendampingan dari guru yang berpengalaman, (ii) di Indonesia saat ini kelompok kerja pengajaran belum dianggap memberikan hasil sesuai harapan karena KKG dan MGMP masih memiliki banyak masalah. Pilihan yang diusulkan untuk masalah ini termasuk, namun tidak terbatas pada, menyediakan program PKB terkait dengan proses kualifikasi guru; kelompok guru seperti KKG / MGMP akan memberikan hasil yang lebih baik jika membantu guru fokus pada penyediaan pembelajaran yang lebih efektif bagi siswa, menggunakan bukti penelitian dan data tentang hasil belajar siswa, membantu guru meninjau dan menyesuaikan praktek mengajar mereka sesuai dengan dampaknya pada belajar siswa, dll .; BERMUTU, sebuah program yang juga bertujuan untuk meningkatkan kurikulum yang digunakan dalam kelompok kerja guru. Program ini merekomendasikan penggunaan program yang lebih koheren didasarkan pada prinsip-prinsip Lesson Study, yang merupakan varian dari pendekatan Penelitian Tindakan Kelas dan sedang diadopsi secara luas secara internasional; dll.

<p>Vocational education in Indonesia is offered formally and informally at the secondary school as well as tertiary education levels. In terms of formal secondary school, it is offered through SMKs, while at the higher education level, it is offered through Diploma I, II&nbsp;and III at polytechnics and/or academies. Enrollment in vocational education has seen a significant increase of 158% between 2001 and 2010. This rapid growth is in large part a reflection of the priority of the government, which has made this sub-sector a key strategy for economic development.</p>

<p>Vocational education at the senior secondary and tertiary levels is mandated under all education-related laws, including <a href=""http://kelembagaan.ristekdikti.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/UU_no_20_th_2003.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Education Law 20/2003</a>. Standards for vocational education are determined by <a href=""http://bsnp-indonesia.org/?page_id=61"" target=""_blank"">National Standards of Education (SNP)</a>, which are operated under the National Education Standards Board (BSNP). Institutional accreditation has been conducted by the <a href=""http://bansm.or.id/"" target=""_blank"">National Accreditation Board for Schools and Madrasahs (BAN SM)</a>, the <a href=""https://banpt.or.id/"" target=""_blank"">National Accreditation Board for Higher Education (BAN PT)</a>&nbsp;and the <a href=""http://web.banpnf.or.id/"" target=""_blank"">National Accreditation Board for Non-Formal Education (BAN PNF)</a>. Teacher certification falls under the supervision of the Board of Education Human Resource Development and Quality Assurance.</p>

<p>To a considerable extent, this expansion of vocational schooling has been &lsquo;supply&rsquo; driven rather than a product of preferences expressed by the private sector, notwithstanding the innovative activities of selected SMKs in building close links with business. The availability of jobs has also been big a problem. There is little evidence that graduates from SMK have significantly different labor market outcomes from SMA graduates. Various studies have also identified the most important issues associated with the expansion of SMKs. They are associated with the <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=42"" target=""_blank"">training, skills and deployment of teachers</a>, while other problems include equipment and facilities, <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=30"" target=""_blank"">curriculum</a>, links with private enterprise and certification of graduates.</p>

<p>Opportunities for SMK students need to be assured, especially those from the poorest households, to pursue further education. Create flexible pathways so that students streamed into vocational education can gain entry into tertiary education. Another option is to explore different methods of providing vocational education, including through a mix of academic and vocational training. Provide vocational training in both tracks of education. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=23"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>Postsecondary education, also known as higher or tertiary education, can be divided into five distinct types, according to <a href=""http://kelembagaan.ristekdikti.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/UU_no_20_th_2003.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Education Law 20/2003</a> and <a href=""http://risbang.ristekdikti.go.id/regulasi/uu-12-2012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Higher Education Law 12/2012</a>: Academies (akademi) and Community Colleges (Akademi Komunitas), polytechnics (politeknik), advanced schools (Sekolah Tinggi), institutes (Institut), and universities (Universitas).</p>

<p>In terms of regulations, <a href=""http://risbang.ristekdikti.go.id/regulasi/uu-12-2012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Higher Education Law 12/2012</a> encapsulates higher education regulations in Indonesia today. The central government is responsible for developing at least one public university in each province and, together with regional governments, is responsible for developing at least one academy at district level. The central government is also responsible for establishing &lsquo;flagship universities&rsquo; (<em>perguruan tinggi unggulan</em>) at national level, and facilitates relationships among higher education institutions, industry, and regional governments. Quality assurance is undertaken internally by the universities themselves and externally by BAN-PT. In terms of financing, central government funding for higher education is present for public and private HEIs.</p>

<p>This is an important issue in Indonesian higher education. There is relatively small budget assigned for research and development. The government&rsquo;s scholarships do not significantly reduce the gap in enrollment between the richest and poorest quintiles. Indonesia&rsquo;s higher education landscape is also characterized by a growth in provision by private institutions. Of the 3,794 total higher education institutions, 96.3% are private. However, public institutions account for 38.3% of enrollments. Generally Java is perceived to offer better quality higher education, which leads to a very high transition rate in those two provinces. Gender inequality also increases as students move up through the various levels of HE, although there are variations between public and private institutions. Female students comprise the majority at the diploma level (S0) in most institutions (except in private faith-based institutions). However, the ratio of females to males tends to fall at each level above that.</p>

<p>In terms of quality, only about 38% of lecturers have master&rsquo;s degrees, doctorate degrees, or specialist degrees at the master or doctorate level.</p>

<p>Certainly, a more cost-effective approach to developing higher education is needed. The government should also continue to push lecturers&rsquo; qualification to be higher, preferably to a PhD. Public tertiary institutions having a more flexible pricing would also be useful, as long as they are also required to give back some of the increased tuition to scholarship programs. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=32"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>The Government of Indonesia has launched an ambitious <a href=""http://www.kemendag.go.id/files/pdf/2012/12/06/master-plan-2011-2025-id0-1354731495.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia Economic Development or MP3EI</a>, with a view to promoting geographically dispersed growth through establishing seven economic corridors across the nation. Yet, universities, industries, and government still operate as three independent spheres and quite distant from one another. Only a small number of examples show the three spheres cooperated productively, and in which universities developed and shared essential knowledge with the other spheres.</p>

<p>None of the three spheres is sufficiently equipped to lead the development of Indonesia&rsquo;s innovation systems. International study visits to Korea and China showed cooperative initiatives to be driven by their respective governments. Given its different political attributes and institutional frameworks, the Indonesian government seemed unable to be as proactive and directive as the respective governments of countries like China or Singapore in realizing a framework for cooperative innovation. In addition, unlike Korea and Japan, Indonesia lacks leading industries capable of contributing to the creation of innovations. In sum, universities are left to the task of pushing university-industry-government (UIG) partnerships, which are essential for generating accelerated and geographically dispersed economic development, as outlined in MP3EI. For that reason, developing universities across the country into strategic institutions has a special significance for Indonesia.</p>

<p>A viable option is to support&nbsp;3-4 universities in the country to develop their research capability to be world class institutions. Investment should be selective but substantial in a relatively small number of institutions, in order to boost their research capacity that may bring spin-offs for other institutions. At least one research university in each region should be developed, and aimed to be of national significance, specializing in certain research topics according to local potentials. All institutions should also ensure their programs are relevant with the industry and national economy priorities by considering input/information from the curriculum advisory committee and representatives of industry. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=33"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>There are four aspects of university autonomy: organizational autonomy, financial autonomy, staffing autonomy, and academic autonomy. University autonomy pertains to the extent it is feasible to implement the specific governance and management autonomy principles in respect to the capacities of MoEC (for leadership, oversight and funding mechanisms) and universities (for implementing institutional reforms). Despite institutional autonomy has been strongly articulated in the higher education law, its implementation is still quite a challenge. With more than 3200 higher education institutions and huge disparities in terms of quality and institutional advancement, the MoEC tends to play more controlling roles rather than systematically decentralize and develop capacity at the university level. From the universities points of perspective, it is safe to say that most institutions are unprepared to implement good university governance principles, which is the prerequisite for autonomy. This is partially due to the patronistic model of governance that have been implemented for some times.</p>

<p>Under <a href=""http://risbang.ristekdikti.go.id/regulasi/uu-12-2012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Higher Education Law 12/2012</a>, the only possible scheme for implementing autonomous governance and management is through PTN-BH. The main obstacles have to do with financial and staffing autonomy. Both the State Finance Law and the Civil Service Law do not provide any room for implementing autonomy principles at public universities. Under PTN-BH however, special scheme for funding allocation and accountability measures have been explicated within the newly issued <a href=""http://kelembagaan.ristekdikti.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PP0582013.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Government Regulation 58/2013</a>, which provides greater range of flexibility, from finance to human resources, for PTN-BH. The current bill on Civil Service (RUU Aparatur Sipil Negara) do provide an opportunity for professional employees such as teachers to follow a special track called Pegawai Pemerintah dengan Perjanjian Kerja (contractual based government employees). Overall, the implementation of institutional reform to achieve university autonomy as envisaged in the law is feasible. However, this necessitate the MoEC to implement a consistent policy towards higher education autonomy as mandated by the Law on Higher Education, and to systematically develop institutional capacity of the public universities which have the potential to be transformed into PTN-BH.</p>

<p>PTN-BH has the highest level of autonomy per law 12/2012. Considering the benefits of PTN-BH, the Government should promote PTN to gradually move towards this type of institutions. PTN with adequate capacity to manage its institution professionally, which demonstrates academic performance with reasonably good standard, and is equipped with adequate human and physical resources, will have to be encouraged to transfer itself into PTN-BH. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=34"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>As one of the largest archipelagic countries in the world, maritime plays a very important role in Indonesia&rsquo;s economy. Indeed, the government has expressed an expectation for maritime&rsquo;s contribution to increase for the country. Unfortunately, matters related to maritime, such as logistics costs, still have a lot to improve in Indonesia. By ASEAN and OECD standards, Indonesia&rsquo;s logistics costs at 25% of GDP is still considered high. The government intends to reduce this cost using sea transport services.</p>

<p>Certainly, commercial shipping, which requires a well-designed maritime education and training (MET) is a major part of such services. A seafarer&rsquo;s career path for officer follows one of two ways: (1) vocational training through diploma-granting institution plus sea service, or (2) non-formal education and training through short courses and experience at sea. In Indonesia, the MOT sets standards for MET providers, assessors, seafarer competences and proficiency levels.</p>

<p>Issues arise at this point. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) provides accreditation for countries&rsquo; MET systems. If Indonesia fails the IMO audit, all Indonesian seafarers would lose their credentials and not be allowed to both work on foreign ships as well as enter foreign ports. In Indonesia, MoEC, MoRTHE, and MOT, all offer MET programs, but only 20% of them meet the IMO standards. A common issue is training providers&rsquo; inability to provide sufficient practical experience through the likes of simulators. Foundational materials tend not to carry the context of maritime and teaching materials tend to fail to speak to seafarers. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=35"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a></p>

<p>Pendidikan dan pelatihan kejuruan diselenggarakan melalui layanan formal dan non-formal. Pendidikan kejuruan formal lebih besar dari dua sub-sektor lain dan diberikan pada tingkat menengah melalui sekolah-sekolah kejuruan menengah atas (SMK) dan tingkat pendidikan tinggi melalui Diploma I, II, III, dan IV termasuk program 3-tahun di politeknik dan akadem. Pendaftaran di pendidikan kejuruan mengalami peningkatan signifikan dari 158% antara tahun 2001 dan 2010. Pertumbuhan yang cepat ini sebagian besar merupakan refleksi dari prioritas pemerintah, yang telah membuat sub-sektor in menjadi &nbsp;strategi utama dalam pembangunan ekonomi.</p>

<p>Pendidikan kejuruan di tingkat menengah dan tinggi diamanatkan dalam semua undang-undang yang berhubungan dengan pendidikan, termasuk UU Pendidikan 20/2003. Standar pendidikan kejuruan ditentukan oleh Standar Nasional Pendidikan (SNP), yang dilaksanakan di bawahBadan Standar Nasional Pendidikan (BSNP). akreditasi kelembagaan telah dilakukan oleh Badan Akreditasi Nasional Sekolah dan Madrasah (BAN SM), Badan Nasional Akreditasi Perguruan Tinggi (BAN PT), dan Badan Akreditasi Nasional Pendidikan Non-Formal (BAN PNF). Sertifikasi guru berada di bawah pengawasan Badan Pendidikan Pengembangan Sumber Daya Manusia dan Jaminan Mutu.</p>

<p>Dalam beberapa hal, ekspansi sekolah kejuruan telah menjadi &#39; supply &#39; driven dan bukan hasil preferensi yang disampaikan oleh sektor swasta, meskipun kegiatan inovatif yang dipilih SMK sangat berhubungan dengan bisnis. Ketersediaan pekerjaan juga telah menjadi masalah. Ada sedikit bukti yang menunjukan lulusan SMK memiliki pasar tenaga kerja yang berbeda dari lulusan SMA. Berbagai penelitian juga telah mengidentifikasi masalah terkait perluasan SMK adalah mengenai pelatihan, keterampilan dan penyebaran guru, sedangkan masalah lainnya ialah peralatan dan fasilitas, kurikulum, hubungan dengan perusahaan swasta serta sertifikasi lulusan.</p>

<p>Peluang siswa SMK harus lebih diberikan, terutama untuk siswa yang berasal dari keluarga miskin, untuk melanjutkan pendidikan. Buatlah &nbsp;jalur yang &nbsp;fleksibel sehingga siswa yang ada di pendidikan kejuruan dapat masuk ke pendidikan tinggi.Pilihan lain adalah untuk menggali metode lain untuk pendidikan kejuruan, termasuk melalui penggabungan pelatihan akademis dan kejuruan. Memberikan pelatihan kejuruan di kedua track pendidikan. Baca lebih lanjut</p>

<p>Pendidikan <em>postsecondary</em>, juga dikenal sebagai pendidikan tinggi atau tersier, dapat dibagi menjadi lima jenis yang berbeda, menurut UU Pendidikan Nomor &nbsp;20/2003 dan UU Pendidikan Tinggi Nomor 12/2012: akademi &nbsp;dan Akademi Komunitas, politeknik, Sekolah Tinggi, Institut, dan Universitas.</p>

<p>Dalam hal peraturan, UU Perguruan Tinggi Nomor 12/2012 merangkum peraturan pendidikan tinggi di Indonesia saat ini. Pemerintah pusat bertanggung jawab untuk mengembangkan setidaknya satu universitas negeri di setiap provinsi dan, bersama-sama dengan pemerintah daerah, bertanggung jawab untuk mengembangkan setidaknya satu akademi di tingkat kabupaten. Pemerintah pusat juga bertanggung jawab untuk membangun &#39; flagship university &#39; ( Perguruan Tinggi Unggulan) di tingkat nasional, dan memfasilitasi hubungan antara lembaga pendidikan tinggi, industri, dan pemerintah daerah. Jaminan kualitas dilakukan secara internal oleh perguruan tinggi sendiri dan secara eksternal oleh BAN - PT. Dalam hal pembiayaan, dana dari pemerintah pusat untuk pendidikan tinggi diberikan untuk perguruan tinggi negeri &nbsp;dan swasta.</p>

<p>Permasalahan ini penting dalam pendidikan tinggi Indonesia. Ada anggaran yang relatif kecil diberikan pada penelitian dan pengembangan. Beasiswa&nbsp; Pemerintah tidak signifikan dalam mengurangi kesenjangan pendaftaran antara kuintil terkaya dan termiskin. Lanskap&nbsp; pendidikan tinggi Indonesia&nbsp; juga ditandai dengan pertumbuhan penyelenggaraan oleh lembaga swasta. Dari 3794 jumlah lembaga pendidikan tinggi, 96,3% adalah swasta sedangkan negeri sebesar 38,3% dari pendaftaran. Biasanya Jawa dianggap memberikan pendidikan yang lebih kualitas, sehingga menimbulkan tingkat transisi yang sangat tinggi di dua provinsi tersebut. Ketidaksetaraan gender juga meningkat karena siswa masuk melalui berbagai tingkat pendidikan tinggi, meskipun ada variasi antara lembaga-lembaga negeri dan swasta. Mayoritas&nbsp; mahasiswi terdiri dari tingkat diploma (S0) di sebagian besar lembaga (kecuali di lembaga-lembaga swasta berbasis keagamaan). Namun, rasio perempuan untuk laki-laki cenderung turun pada setiap tingkat tersebut.</p>

<p>Dalam hal kualitas, hanya sekitar 38% dosen memiliki gelar Master, gelar doktor, atau gelar spesialis tingkat mater atau doktoral. Menurut laporan BAN-PT tahun 2012, kualitas banyak PT di Indonesia masih rendah.</p>

<p>Tentu saja, pendekatan efektif berbiaya rendah&nbsp; untuk mengembangkan pendidikan tinggi diperlukan. Pemerintah juga harus terus mendorong dosen memiliki kualifikasi yang lebih tinggi, seperti program PhD. Perguruan tinggi negeri dengan biaya yang lebih fleksibel juga akan berguna, asalkan mereka juga&nbsp; memberikan kembali beberapa peningkatan biaya kuliah untuk program beasiswa.

<p>Pemerintah Indonesia telah meluncurkan Masterplan ambisius untuk Percepatan dan Perluasan Pembangunan Ekonomi Indonesia atau MP3EI, dengan tujuan untuk meningkatkan pertumbuhan secara geografis melalui pembentukan tujuh koridor ekonomi di seluruh bangsa. Namun, perguruan tinggi, industri, dan pemerintah masih berjalan sebagai tiga lembaga yang berjalan sendiri dan jauh satu sama lain. Hanya sejumlah kecil contoh yang menunjukkan tiga lembaga tersebut bekerjasama secara produktif, dan universitas mengembangkan dan berbagi pengetahuan penting dengan bidang-bidang lain.</p>

<p>Tak satu pun dari tiga lembaga siap dengan sistem inovasi pembangunan Indonesia. Kunjungan studi internasional ke Korea dan Cina menunjukkan inisiatif kerjasama yang didorong oleh pemerintah masing-masing. Mengingat sifat politik dan kerangka kerja institusional yang berbeda, pemerintah Indonesia tidak proaktif dan direktif sepereti pemerintah negara lain seperti China atau Singapura dalam mewujudkan kerangka inovasi kerjasama. Selain itu, tidak seperti Korea dan Jepang, Indonesia tidak memiliki industri terkemuka yang mampu memberikan kontribusi bagi penciptaan inovasi. Singkatnya, universitas memiliki tugas penting mendorong kemitraan yang penting untuk menghasilkan percepatan pembangunan ekonomi dan geografis, seperti diuraikan dalam MP3EI. Untuk itu, pengembangan universitas di seluruh negeri menjadi lembaga strategis penting bagi Indonesia.</p>

<p>Pilihan penting seperti mendorong &nbsp;3-4 universitas di negara ini untuk mengembangkan kemampuan penelitian menjadi lembaga kelas dunia. Investasi harus selektif namun substansial untuk beberapa lembaga, dalam rangka meningkatkan kapasitas penelitian lembaga. Setidaknya satu universitas riset di masing-masing daerah harus dikembangkan, dan bertujuan untuk mengkhususkan diri dalam topik penelitian tertentu sesuai dengan potensi lokal. semua lembaga juga harus memastikan relevansi program dengan industri dan prioritas ekonomi nasional dengan mempertimbangkan masukan / informasi dari komite penasihat kurikulum dan perwakilan dari industri.

<div class=""collapsible-item-body panel-body"">
<p>Ada empat aspek otonomi universitas: otonomi organisasi, otonomi keuangan, otonomi kepegawaian, dan otonomi akademik. Otonomi perguruan tinggi berkaitan dengan kelayakan untuk menerapkan prinsip-prinsip tata kelola dan otonomi manajemen khusus sehubungan dengan kapasitas Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan (untuk mekanisme kepemimpinan, pengawasan dan pendanaan) dan universitas (untuk melaksanakan reformasi kelembagaan). Meskipun otonomi institusional telah dimasukan dalam pendidikan tinggi hukum, pelaksanaannya masih cukup bermasalah. Dengan lebih dari 3200 lembaga pendidikan tinggi dan kesenjanganyang &nbsp;besar dalam kualitas dan kemajuan kelembagaan, Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan cenderung memainkan peran lebih sebagai &nbsp;pengendali dibanding &nbsp;desentralisasi dan mengembangkan kapasitas secara &nbsp;sistematis di tingkat universitas. Berdasarkan &nbsp;perspektif universitas ini, tampaknya sebagian besar lembaga tidak siap untuk menerapkan prinsip-prinsip good university governance, yang merupakan prasyarat untuk otonomi. Hal ini sebagian karena model patronistic pemerintahan yang telah dilaksanakan beberapa kali.</p>

<p>Berdasarkan UU &nbsp;Pendidikan Tinggi Nomor 12/2012, skema yang dapat melaksanakan pemerintahan dan manajemen otonom adalah melalui PTN-BH. Hambatan utamanya terkait dengan otonomi keuangan dan kepegawaian. Baik UU Keuangan Negara maupun Pegawai Negeri Sipil Hukum tidak memberikan ruang untuk menerapkan prinsip-prinsip otonomi di perguruan tinggi negeri. Namun di bawah PTN-BH, skema khusus untuk alokasi pendanaan dan langkah pertanggungjawabannya &nbsp;telah dinyatakan dalam Peraturan Pemerintah yang baru diterbitkan PP Nomor 58/2013, yang memberikan fleksibilitas lebih besar, dalam keuangan hingga sumber daya manusia, untuk PTN-BH. RUU Aparatur Sipil Negara memberikan kesempatan bagi pegawai profesi seperti guru untuk mengikuti jalur khusus yang disebut Pegawai Pemerintah dengan Perjanjian Kerja. Secara keseluruhan, pelaksanaan reformasi kelembagaan untuk mencapai otonomi perguruan tinggi seperti yang disebutkan dalam undang-undang sudah layak. Namun, Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan harus menerapkan kebijakan yang konsisten terhadap otonomi pendidikan tinggi sebagaimana diamanatkan oleh Undang-Undang Pendidikan Tinggi, dan untuk secara sistematis mengembangkan kapasitas kelembagaan perguruan tinggi negeri yang memiliki potensi untuk diubah menjadi PTN-BH.</p>

<p>PTN-BH memiliki tingkat otonomi menurut UU 12/2012. Mengingat manfaat dari PTN-BH, pemerintah harus mempromosikan PTN untuk secara bertahap menjadi PTN-BH. PTN dengan kapasitas yang memadai dalam mengelola lembaga secara profesional, yang menunjukkan kinerja akademik dengan standar yang cukup baik, dan dilengkapi dengan sumber daya manusia dan fisik yang memadai, harus didorong untuk berubah menjadi PTN-BH.

<p>Sebagai salah satu negara kepulauan terbesar di dunia, maritim memainkan peran yang sangat penting dalam &nbsp;perekonomian Indonesia. Memang, pemerintah memiliki harapan pada berkembangnya kontribusi maritim. Sayangnya, hal yang berkaitan dengan maritim, seperti biaya logistik, masih memiliki banyak untuk meningkatkan di Indonesia. Menurut standar ASEAN dan OECD, biaya logistik Indonesia&nbsp; 25% dari PDB masih dianggap tinggi. Pemerintah bermaksud untuk mengurangi biaya ini dengan menggunakan jasa transportasi laut.</p>

<p>Tentu saja, pelayaran komersial, yang memerlukan rancangan pendidikan dan pelatihan maritim (MET) yang baik merupakan bagian utama dari layanan tersebut. Jalur karir pelaut mengikuti salah satu dari dua cara: (1) pelatihan kejuruan melalui program diploma plus layanan kelautan, atau (2) pendidikan dan pelatihan non formal melalui kursus singkat dan pengalaman di laut. Di Indonesia, Kementrian Perhubungan menetapkan standar bagi penyedia, penilai, kompetensi pelaut dan tingkat kemahiran MET.</p>

<p>Masalah timbul pada saat ini. Organisasi Maritim Internasional (OMI) memberikan akreditasi bagi negara-negara yang berada dalam sistem MET. Jika Indonesia gagal audit OMI, maka semua pelaut Indonesia akan kehilangan identitasnya dan tidak akan diizinkan untuk bekerja di kapal asing serta masuk pelabuhan asing. Di Indonesia, Kemendikbud, Kemenristekdikti, dan Kemenhub, semua memberikan program MET, tetapi hanya 20% dari mereka memenuhi standar OMI. Masalah umum yang ada &nbsp;adalah ketidakmampuan penyedia pelatihan untuk memberikan pengalaman praktis seperti melalui simulator. Materi yang diberikan seringkali keluar konteks kemaritiman dan bahan pengajaran pun tidak menyentuh permasalahan terkait pelaut. Baca lebih lanjut</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Di Papua, Yayasan, yang didukung oleh lembaga keagamaan tertentu, memberikan layanan melalui sekolah dan masyarakat baik di daerah terpencil perkotaan maupun pedesaan. Beberapa contohnya adalah (i) Yayasan Agama Islam (YAPIS) oleh umat Islam, (ii) Yayasan Pendidikan Advent (YPA) oleh Gereja Advent, (iii) Yayasan Pendidikan Kristen (YPK) oleh Gereja Kristen Indonesia , (iv) Yayasan Pendidikan dan Persekolahan Gereja-Gereja Injili (YPPGI) oleh lima gereja Injili Protestan yang berbeda dan (v) Yayasan Pendidikan dan Persekolahan Katolik (YPPK) oleh Gereja Katolik Roma. Yayasan ini mendominasi pendidikan swasta di Papua - jumlahnya lebih dari 95% sekolah-sekolah swasta di pedesaan dan terpencil. Rencana Strategis menunjukkan bahwa peran Yayasan telah diakui sebagai bagian penting dari strategi dalam penyelenggaraan pendidikan dasar yang berkualitas bagi daerah pedesaan dan terpencil. Oleh karena itu, Dinas Pendidikan Provinsi dan Kabupaten harus bekerja sama dengan Yayasan tersebut, dan memastikan agar sumber daya pemerintah dapat meningkatkan &nbsp;sumber daya yayasan bila diperlukan.</li>

<p>It is a common practice in rural and remote areas throughout the world.

</ul>

<p>To learn skills that were necessary in the local context, YKW, through SERASI funding, developed and evaluated a Papua-specific primary school Mathematics and Bahasa Indonesia curriculum. YKW evaluated local learning behaviors and the most common words that are used in the local languages to teach these words through activities as well as using local symbols to teach number concepts. <a href=""http://belantara.or.id/"">Belantara Foundation</a> documents and combines existing oral stories and games into literacy exercises. This program was also supported by SERASI. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ObAnggenPapua/?rf=213408555485002"">Ob&nbsp;Anggen School</a>, which is also supported by SERASI, aims to improve teaching quality, provide supplementary health education, and expand to satellite schools. Teachers were given professional development and computers and promethean active boards were provided. Local youth was provided with vocational and technical training programs by Ob&nbsp;Anggen.</p>

<p><strong>IPPM - THE SEKOLAH KAMPUNG (VILLAGE SCHOOL) </strong>is an appropriate way to bring education services closer to remote villages in Papua is the village school.</p>

<ul>
	<li>IPPM established village schools in three villages (Betaf, Beneraf and Yamna) in Pantai Timur sub-district, Sarmi District and involved local stakeholders to support the village schools implementation</li>
	<li>Village schools need community members who are capable and have good interaction to facilitate learning process</li>
	<li>The local community has provided their contribution for a school building, by using the village development funds (Dana <a href=""http://psflibrary.org/catalog/repository/3908%20Studi%20Penilaian%20Penerima%20Manfaat%20PNPM%20RESPEK%20IND.pdf"" target=""_blank"">RESPEK</a>) to build schools. They also worked together to build playing equipment and media using local materials, while IPPM contributed books, paint, nails and other fabricated materials.</li>
	<li>All 134 children attending the village schools are now enrolled in elementary schools and it has been confirmed by the teachers that children from village schools were very good in class and made better progress. This proves that village schools are an appropriate model to encourage the children to attend elementary schools</li>
	<li>IPPM used KAT Empowerment Approach in the process of developing Sekolah Kampung. KAT&rsquo;s components are to understand the constraints to education provision and the perception of the education benefits that can bring welfare and development of the community.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WORLD VISION: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, TRANSFORMATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND THE INTEGRATION OF SERVICES </strong>focuses on children and projects to improve the life and well-being of the children on long term development.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Integrates development, relief and advocacy in work to maximize impact</li>
	<li>Promotes the children well-being as the best indicator for good development, emphasizing maternal and child health</li>
	<li>Emphasizes the need to build trust before working with a community, spending a period working and talking with the communities to build trust with religious, ethnic, government, and informal leaders</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UNICEF MODELS FOR RURAL AND REMOTE AREAS</strong>. Two key areas for accelerating education development in Tanah Papua that had been identified by UNICEF are: (i) Improving access and quality of education services and (ii) improving governance of public services.</p>

<ul>
	<li>UNICEF provides support to the Papuan government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Affirmative Education Policy&rdquo; to support the small schools provision at village level for rural children in Grades 1-3, &ldquo;single-roof&rdquo; schools where elementary and junior secondary aged children are combined in the same school, and boarding facilities for children who need to live away from home because of the distance from home to existing school.</li>
	<li>The <a href=""http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pnaam523.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pamong strategy</a> or &ldquo;visiting teacher model for rural and isolated areas&rdquo; is an attempt to move learning to out-of-school children in rural and isolated areas by developing modularized instructional materials in combination with community involvement in teaching, tutoring, monitoring and the organisation of learning activities and materials.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://thejungleschool.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank""><strong>THE SOKOLA RIMBA (Jungle School)</strong></a>.<strong> </strong>Butet Manurung, an educator and activist, is famous for her book Sokola Rimba (Jungle School) about her teaching experiences in the NGO conservation group, <a href=""http://www.warsi.or.id/"" target=""_blank"">WARSI</a>, where she led their education program for the Orang Rimba, or &ldquo;People of the Forest&rdquo;, the indigenous peoples in the rainforest of Jambi, Sumatra. Following are the issues from Butet&rsquo;s reflection on the basic requirement for the program:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Lessons need to be tailored to the Orang Rimba daily activities</strong>, Education materials need to be relevant to their needs and way of life. The materials also need to be designed appropriately to take into account the comprehension levels of the children.</li>
	<li><strong>The Orang Rimba need to receive some benefit from any education program</strong>, The Orang Rimba themselves need to recognize the education benefits. Any program seeking to redirect a certain community outlook would not succeed if the people do not share the belief that it is beneficial to them. Thus any program benefits have to far exceed the negative spill over resulting in the acceptance of the change. It is also important that these benefits are maintained into the future and are open to revision if necessary.</li>
	<li><strong>The education process needs to be locally organized,</strong> The involvement of local people into the mix is likely to aid learning. Total integration by the teacher into the life of the Orang Rimba, with intermittent time outside the community, would contribute profound insights into any perception daps between the two worlds.</li>
	<li><strong>The education program needs to facilitate critical analytic skills and provide skills to assist the community in coping with the development challenges ahead, </strong>There is a need for critical analytical skills to deal effectively with development and environmental changes. Development plans need to be explained in a transparent and honest way to each decisionmaker and the inherent risks, which might affect their lives, need to be apparent.</li>
	<li><strong>The basic goal of any education program includes facilitating the Orang Rimba&rsquo;s capacity for self-realization, providing a vision for the future and developing self-integrity within the Rimba community</strong>, Education programs should be aimed towards preparing the Orang Rimba to fend off external pressure, thus enabling them to master their own future direction.</li>

	<li>It fights to empower minority language community through research and literacy programs, assisting the community in promoting their language, education and development by preserving the culture uniqueness and language</li>
	<li>SIL Papua has been active in the construction of linguistic and school maps &ndash; an activity essential for the coordination and effective planning of social service provision and education in Papua</li>
	<li>The SIL Language Maps define existing language boundaries in Papua and West Papua. The languages in these provinces have been evaluated by SIL through the following methods: (a) Lexical similarity comparisons between the speech varieties used between villages and with villages of the neighboring languages; (b) using interviews with community members regarding perceived degrees of similarity and intelligibility between the surveyed villages as well as the perceived degrees of similarity and intelligibility between each language and the surrounding languages; (c) interviews with community members of the surrounding languages regarding the perceived degrees of similarity and intelligibility between their language and the neighboring language</li>
	<li>Triangulation methodologies were used to evaluate, if what was reported to the different researchers was also be observed in the community, to ensure the high reliability and validity of the data</li>
	<li>Cartography Software is rated as one of the world&rsquo;s best. ArcView GIS Version 10 covers the full range of geographic information systems (GIS). ArcView GIS is a high-end, full-featured geographic information system which supports the kind of scientific research characterized by this mapping project.</li>
</ul>

<p>The school has its limitations. Mapping data provided to the government is so faulty that they refused to use it. To move forward, the research team used its own extensive GPS language mapping database constructed by their on-the-ground survey team, while also working with helicopter, bush plane and missionary aviation airlines to further get accurate GPS coordinates of villages and towns. Local governments, and local language informants were also enlisted to provide first-hand information on names of villages and locations, to provide the best elementary school maps to date.</p>

<ul>
	<li>IPPM mendirikan sekolah kampung di tiga desa (Betaf, Beneraf dan Yamna) di Kecamatan Pantai Timur, Kabupaten Sarmi dan pemangku kepentingan setempat terlibat untuk membantu pelaksanaan sekolah kampung ini</li>
	<li>Sekolah kampung memerlukan anggota masyarakat yang mampu dan memiliki interaksi yang baik untuk memfasilitasi proses pembelajaran</li>
	<li>Masyarakat setempat telah memberikan sumbangan pembangunan gedung sekolah, dengan menggunakan dana pembangunan desa (Dana RESPEK).

<p>SOKOLA RIMBA. Butet Manurung, seorang pendidik dan aktivis, terkenal dengan bukunya Sokola Rimba menceritakan tentang pengalaman mengajarnya dalam kelompok konservasi LSM, WARSI, di mana dia memimpin Program pendidikan untuk Orang Rimba, atau &ldquo; Orang Hutan &rdquo; , masyarakat adat di hutan hujan Jambi, Sumatera. Berikut ini adalah permasalahan dari hasil refleksi Butet pada kebutuhan dasar untuk program:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Pelajaran harus disesuaikan dengan kegiatan sehari-hari Orang Rimba</strong>. Materi pendidikan harus relevan dengan kebutuhan dan cara hidup mereka. Materi juga perlu dirancang dengan tepat untuk memperhitungkan tingkat pemahaman anak-anak.</li>
	<li><strong>Orang Rimba harus mendapatkan manfaat dari program pendidikan</strong>. Orang Rimba sendiri harus menyadari akan manfaat pendidikan. Setiap program upaya untuk mengarahkan pandangan masyarakat tidak akan berhasil jika orang-orang tidak memiliki keyakinan yang sama bahwa program tersebut bermanfaat bagi mereka. Dengan demikian manfaat program yang jauh melebihi akibat negatifnya akan menghasilkan perubahan. Manfaat ini juga penting untuk dipertahankan di masa depan dan siap untuk revisi jika diperlukan.</li>
	<li><strong>Proses pendidikan harus diselenggarakan secara lokal</strong>. Keterlibatan masyarakat lokal ke dalam program adalah untuk membantu belajar. Integrasi guru ke dalam kehidupan Orang Rimba, dengan menghabiskan banyak waktu bersama masyarakat, akan memberikan wawasan yang mendalam pada pembentukan persepsi tentang dunia mereka.</li>
	<li><strong>Program pendidikan harus memfasilitasi keterampilan analitik kritis dan memberikan keterampilan untuk membantu masyarakat dalam mengatasi tantangan pembangunan ke depan</strong>. Ada kebutuhan kemampuan analisis kritis untuk menghadapi perkembangan dan perubahan lingkungan secara efektif. Rencana pembangunan perlu dijelaskan secara transparan dan jujur Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹untuk setiap pembuat keputusan dan berikut risiko yang muncul, yang mungkin mempengaruhi kehidupan mereka, harus jelas.</li>
	<li><strong>Tujuan dasar dari setiap program pendidikan diantaranya ialah memfasilitasi kemampuan realisasi diri &nbsp;Orang Rimba, memberikan visi untuk masa depan dan mengembangkan integritas diri dalam komunitas Rimba</strong>. Program pendidikan harus ditujukan untuk menyiapkan Orang Rimba dalam menghadapi tekanan eksternal, sehingga mereka mampu menguasai arah masa depan mereka sendiri.</li>

<p>SUMMER INSTITUTE OF LINGUISTIC (SIL INTERNATIONAL): PEMETAAN MASYARAKAT BAHASA DAN SEKOLAH. SIL International-Indonesia adalah organisasi non-profit yang memiliki status konsultatif dengan UNESCO</p>

<ul>
	<li>SIL berupaya untuk memberdayakan masyarakat bahasa minoritas melalui penelitian dan program literasi, membantu masyarakat untuk mempromosikan bahasa mereka, pendidikan dan pengembangan dengan melestarikan keunikan budaya dan bahasa</li>
	<li>SIL Papua aktif dalam pembangunan peta linguistik dan sekolah - kegiatan penting untuk koordinasi dan perencanaan yang efektif penyediaan layanan sosial dan pendidikan di Papua</li>
	<li>Peta Bahasa SIL menentukan batas-batas bahasa yang ada di Papua dan Papua Barat. Bahasa di provinsi ini telah dievaluasi oleh SIL melalui metode berikut: (a) membandingkan kesamaan leksikal antara berbagai pidato yang digunakan antara desa dan dengan desa-desa dari bahasa tetangga; (B) menggunakan wawancara dengan anggota masyarakat tentang tingkat kesamaan dan kejelasan antara desa yang disurvei serta tingkat kesamaan dan kejelasan antara masing-masing bahasa dan bahasa sekitarnya; (C) wawancara dengan anggota masyarakat dari bahasa sekitarnya mengenai tingkat kesamaan dan kejelasan antara bahasa mereka dan bahasa tetangga</li>
	<li>Metodologi triangulasi digunakan untuk mengevaluasi, jika apa yang dilaporkan para peneliti yang berbeda juga diamati di masyarakat, untuk menjamin realibilitas dan validitas data</li>
	<li>Software Kartografi dinilai sebagai salah satu yang terbaik di dunia. ArcView Version mencakup berbagai sistem informasi geografis (GIS). ArcView GIS adalah &nbsp;sistem informasi geografis yang bagus yang dapat membantu jenis penelitian ilmiah yang ditandai dengan proyek pemetaan ini.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sekolah memiliki keterbatasan. Data pemetaan yang diberikan kepada pemerintah sangat jelek sehingga mereka menolak untuk menggunakannya. Agar tetap terlaksana, tim peneliti menggunakan database pemetaan bahasa GPS yang dibuat oleh tim survei lahan mereka, sambil juga bekerja dengan penerbangan helikopter, pesawat dan penerbangan misionaris untuk lebih mendapatkan koordinat GPS yang akurat dari desa dan kota. Pemerintah daerah, dan informan bahasa lokal juga diminta untuk memberikan informasi tentang nama-nama desa dan lokasi, untuk memberikan peta sekolah dasar yang terbaik saat ini.</p>

"12","1","Overall Strategic Options for Education in Rural and Remote Areas","<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>Policy Decisions for Rural and Isolated Communities</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Empower and educate local communities to embrace their village school ownership and success, which can be done through a variation of a PRA technique. Village-level school boards could be conducted to formulate an agreement between the community and the Dinas Education Office. The agreements need to address the Dinas and the community concerns. The key component of <a href=""http://www.tnp2k.go.id/en"" target=""_blank"">TNP2K</a>&rsquo;s proposed project for improving teacher accountability and performance in remote areas to possible include Tanah Papua is to facilitate community based solutions including a point of payment for teachers&rsquo; salaries. With this concept, the community would be engaged on issues of the education benefits, the identification of a local language, a community teacher identification, provision of an initial school and support for culturally relevant learning resources, etc.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>Select an Appropriate and Effective Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE) Model</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">(i) The policy option presented in this Strategy is to follow the model of Papua New Guinea and the Philippines and institute <a href=""/collection-detail.php?lang=1&amp;link=collection&amp;id=144"" target=""_blank"">Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE)</a> for isolated monolingual communities for the first three grades of school. MTB-MLE needs to bridge to Bahasa Indonesia&nbsp;after basic literacy has been attained in the mother tongue. A Study Visit by relevant staff of the districts and sub-district offices to PNG and/or the Philippines would be valuable in reviewing their language programs.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">(ii) As part of this policy option, an Institute or Language and Culture Division within the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DIKPORA) would be established devoted to (a) developing Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education for rural and remote communities who choose MTB-MLE and (b) train and work with the village level school boards to strengthen local leadership capacity and engage with the communities on issues of language and schooling.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">(iii) The newly formed DIKPORA Language and Culture Division would educate and train the above mentioned village-level school boards to make informed decisions regarding the role of mother tongue education for the first three grades of schooling. If the community chooses to embrace Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education (Mother tongue and Indonesian), have the Language and Culture Division work with the local community (and other language/education NGOs) to develop the needed curriculum.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">(iv) A third grade reading/writing/arithmetic assessment tool would be instituted that can be easily adapted for Papuan minority languages.This assessment would not necessarily be conducted at one time but could span three stages, including emerging literacy, basic decoding (letter/sounds), and reading fluency with comprehension by the end of grade 3. This tool is meant to be an early warning system to measure that national academic benchmarks for the third grade are being met through MTB-MLE. This is critical if the specifi c focus on education in rural and remote areas is not to be seen as a deficit model of education provided in urban or peri-urban areas. The compelling case for instruction in the mother tongue is that children will learn better; not only in the early grades to develop literacy and numeracy but also in later grade when they have transitioned into Bahasa Indonesia. The close monitoring and evaluation through low-stress and &ldquo;low-stakes&rdquo; student learning assessments will be critical in this regard. A modification of the USAID supported <a href=""http://www.epdc.org/data-about-epdc-data-epdc-learning-outcomes-data/egra-and-egma"" target=""_blank"">EGRA (Early Grade Reading Assessment) and EGMA (Early Grade Mathematics Assessment)</a> for measuring individual skills in mathematics/numeracy142 would be developed in the languages of instruction for this purpose.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">(v) Work with <a href=""https://www.sil.org/"" target=""_blank"">SIL</a> Indonesia and Yayasan Abdi Nusantara to map languages, language vitality and school locations in the province. This is to support educational administrators in tracking appropriate school curricular needs, language concerns, student/teacher attendance, location of schools, etc.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">(vi) Establish the responsibility of the kabupaten in which most of the rural and remote communities reside (Deiyai, Yahukimo, Pegunungan Bintang, Intan Jaya, Membramo, Nduga, Lanny Jaya, Yalimo and Puncak) identify to the newly formed DIKPORA Language and Culture Division where they would like to initiate implementation of the community-based school boards and mother tongue based multilingual education strategy.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>KPG Reform</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""text-align:justify"">Ensure that the <em>Kolese Pendidikan Guru</em>/Teacher Education College&nbsp;(KPG) in Nabire, Merauke, Mimika (in Papua) and Sarong (in West Papua) train teachers for remote and rural school</li>
	<li style=""text-align:justify"">Ensure the KPG cooperate with UNCEN that suits to an appropriate UNCEN curriculum as well as develop their own unique curriculum that puts Papuan rural and remote students first.</li>
	<li style=""text-align:justify"">KPG is meant to train quality elementary school teachers for the unique Papuan context.</li>
	<li style=""text-align:justify"">Revisit the curriculum that is used in the KPG to ensure it is driven be educational needs experienced by rural and remote Papuan school teachers and make it &ldquo;khas Papua&rdquo; (especially Papuan).</li>
	<li style=""text-align:justify"">Restructure the KPG dormitory so that it has a &ldquo;Papuan Family Feel.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Teachers should also be trained in a dual subject specialization (a major as well as a minor subject). The new policies that national government is currently implementing are: (i) imposing quotas for the number of students who can enter teacher training institutes (responding to the overall surplus number of teachers, the extremely low student-teacher ratio (STR 16:1 (SD) and 13:1 (SMP)143 ) but inequitable distribution, especially to RRA where there is a drastic shortage), (ii) improving student selection; (iii) providing scholarships for students taking up the teaching profession; and (iv) introducing a system of multi-subject teaching.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>Review of&nbsp;<a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=31"" target=""_blank"">ICT Use and Potential</a></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""text-align:justify"">Connecting rural and isolated communities, schools and learning centers, to modern communication grids to conduct an intensive evaluation of the programs effectiveness.</li>
	<li style=""text-align:justify"">Encourage UNCEN or (UT) Universitas Terbuka/The Open University, to launch an education major in Rural and Remote Education that supports the career path of rural and remote teacher</li>
	<li style=""text-align:justify"">Information on remote and isolated schools and communities without schools is unreliable, especially in Papua, therefore there is a need of an effort to merge the current state of knowledge to get a multi-dimensional picture (e.g. location of schools by language and ethnicity or tribe).</li>
</ul>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>Development of Models of Rural-Remote Community School</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""text-align:justify"">The blending of formal, non-formal and informal approaches to schooling has provided new models of schools such as the sekolah kampong provides a different approach to the boarding school model of the &ldquo;Affirmative Education&rdquo; model. There is a need to work closely with the diverse cultural, linguistic and ethnic communities throughout the rural/remote areas. Engaging in the communities will ensure that education provision (the supply) will respond to the needs, wants and benefits of these diverse communities (the demand).</li>
	<li style=""text-align:justify""><a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=43"" target=""_blank"">Minimum Service Standards (MSS)</a>:
	<ul style=""list-style-type:circle"">
		<li>An option to determine MSS for schools situated in rural and remote areas. There is enough regulatory framework to review&nbsp;MSS for RRA schools</li>
		<li>They were an attempt to set a lower level than the existing National Education Standards (NES), which with their 700 or more indicators (in eight&nbsp;categories/standards), provided a high standard for schools that were in many ways unrealistic at the time</li>
		<li>The MSS offers a &ldquo;benchmark or standard for the performance of <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=1"" target=""_blank"">basic education</a> services delivered through the formal education system administered by districts/cities&rdquo;&nbsp;consisting of 27 items covering indicators relating to:
		<ul>
			<li>Government and private primary schools and madrasah (SD/MI)</li>
			<li>Government and private Junior secondary schools and madrasah (SMP/MT)</li>
			<li>Local education authorities at the level of districts/cities, including education departments (MoEC) and the equivalent offi ces of the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA).</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The current MSS are available at two levels: for every school (involving 13 standards related to facilities, teachers, curriculum, assessment, quality assurance, and school management) and for each district (14 standards covering facilities, teachers, curriculum&nbsp;and quality assurance) as a first step to achieving the NES for basic education, covering primary and junior secondary schools.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>Governance - Capacity Development</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">To improve current <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=4"" target=""_blank"">governance</a> in the decentralized system, reforms of the extensive and complex nature will need to be accompanied by significant capacity development programs. Governance applies to the education office from province to district, sub-district to school level, and also the wider system involved in the governing process. For instance, UNICEF partners the governments of both provinces in the provision of technical support and training in the area of equity-based planning using a rights-based approach, improving budgeting and financial management in line with an equity focus and to improve government accountability. The two significant policies that will impact on the governance and equity issues are: (i) the increased allocation of Special Autonomy funds (Otsus) to the districts: from the current situation of 60% for district and 40% for provincial level, to 80% for districts and 20% for provinces. Of the budget of 80% allocated to the districts, the amount used for education will be at the discretion of the district office (allocated according to need). The intention is to accelerate service provision at district level. (ii) 5% of the 80% transferred to the districts will be earmarked for education services provided through the religious foundations (yayasan). This has the potential to address many of the funding constraints facing the yayasan if used effectively.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The Strategic Plan has emphasized the important principle, starting with an effective dialogue with the communities in the rural and remote location of Tanah Papua. The need to ensure that education service provision responds to community demand is essential to this strategy. The government will have demands in meeting national education standards or in meeting the labor market and skills demands for economic development plans such as <a href=""http://www.kemendag.go.id/files/pdf/2012/12/06/master-plan-2011-2025-id0-1354731495.pdf"" target=""_blank"">MP3EI</a> for the region. While the indigenous communities will have their own unique demands for education related to their perception of the benefits (or sometimes cultural threats) that learning will bring to the community.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Global practices on governance reforms promoting decentralization as a method of improving educational services identify a range of strategies related to planning, budgeting, transparency and accountability,&nbsp;and school autonomy.</p>

","Pilihan Strategis untuk Pendidikan di Daerah Pedesaan dan Terpencil","<p><strong>Keputusan Kebijakan untuk Masyarakat Pedesaan dan Terpencil</strong></p>

<p>Memberdayakan dan mendidik masyarakat setempat agar merasa memiliki pada sekolah kampung dan untuk mewujudkannya dapat dilakukan melalui beberapa teknik PRA. Dewan sekolah kampung dapat dibentuk untuk merumuskan kesepakatan antara masyarakat dan Dinas Pendidikan Dinas. Kesepakatan tersebut harus mencakup&nbsp; &nbsp;keprihatinan Dinas dan masyarakat. Komponen utama proyek TNP2K140&nbsp; peningkatan akuntabilitas dan kinerja guru di daerah terpencil seperti Tanah Papua adalah untuk memberikan solusi berbasis masyarakat termasuk masalah pembayaran gaji guru. Dengan konsep ini, masyarakat dapat memahami manfaat pendidikan, identifikasi bahasa lokal, identifikasi guru masyarakat, penyediaan sekolah awal dan bantuan untuk sumber pembelajaran daya yang relevan dengan budaya, dll</p>

<p><strong>Memilih Model Pendidikan Multi Bahasa dengan Penggunaan Bahasa Ibu (MTB-MLE) yang Tepat dan Efektif</strong></p>

<p>(I) Opsi kebijakan yang disajikan dalam Strategi ini mengikuti model Papua Nugini dan Filipina dan MTB-MLE bagi masyarakat monolingual terisolasi untuk tiga tingkat pertama persekolahan. MTB-MLE menjembatani ke pembelajaran &nbsp;Bahasa Indonesia setelah keaksaraan dasar dalam bahasa ibu telah tercapai. Kunjungan penelitian &nbsp;oleh staf yang relevan dari kantor kabupaten dan kecamatan ke PNG dan / atau Filipina akan bermanfaat &nbsp;untuk melihat program bahasa mereka.</p>

<p>(ii) Sebagai bagian dari pilihan kebijakan ini, Lembaga atau Divisi Budaya atau Bahasa di bawah Departemen Pendidikan, Kebudayaan dan Olahraga (Dikpora) akan didirikan dikhususkan untuk (a) Pendidikan multibahasa dengan menggunakan bahasa ibu untuk &nbsp;masyarakat pedesaan dan terpencil yang memilih MTB-MLE dan (b) melatih dan bekerja dengan dewan sekolah tingkat desa untuk memperkuat kapasitas kepemimpinan lokal dan terlibat dengan masyarakat dalam menatasi permasalahan bahasa dan pendidikan.</p>

<p>(iii) Divisi Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Dikpora yang baru dibentuk mendidik dan melatih dewan sekolah tersebut di atas dalam membuat keputusan terkait peran pendidikan bahasa ibu untuk tiga tingkat pertama persekolahan. Jika masyarakat menggunakan pendekatan pengajaran multibahasa dengan menggunakan bahasa ibu (Bahasa ibu dan bahasa Indonesia), Divisi Bahasa dan Budaya harus bekerja sama dengan masyarakat setempat (dan dengan LSM bahasa / pendidikan lainnya) untuk mengembangkan kurikulum yang dibutuhkan.</p>

<p>(iv) Penilaian membaca / menulis / aritmatika di kelas tiga akan disesuaikan agar mempermudah bahasa minoritas di Papua. Penilaian ini tidak dilakukan pada satu waktu tetapi dalam tiga tahap, yaitu tahapan memunculkan literasi, decoding dasar (surat / suara), dan membaca lancar dengan pemahaman pada akhir kelas 3. Penilaian ini dimaksudkan sebagai sistem peringatan dini untuk mengukur bahwa tolok ukur akademis nasional untuk kelas tiga tercapai melalui MTB - MLE. Hal ini penting jika&nbsp; fokus pendidikan di pedesaan dan daerah terpencil tidak dianggap sebagai model defisit pendidikan yang diberikan di perkotaan atau daerah pedesaan. Kasus yang menarik tentang pengajaran dalam bahasa ibu adalah bahwa anak-anak akan belajar lebih baik; tidak hanya di kelas awal untuk mengembangkan membaca dan menghitung tetapi juga di kelas kemudian ketika mereka beralih ke dalam Bahasa Indonesia. Monitoring dan evaluasi yang intensif dalam penilaian belajar siswa yang rendah&nbsp; stres dan &ldquo;rendah - resiko &rdquo; akan menjadi penting dalam hal ini. Modifikasi dari USAID membantu Egra (Early kelas Reading Assessment) dan EGMA untuk mengukur keterampilan individu dalam matematika / berhitung 142 akan dikembangkan dalam bahasa pengantar untuk mencapai tujuan ini.</p>

<p>(V) Bekerja dengan SIL Indonesia dan Yayasan Abdi Nusantara untuk memetakan bahasa, manfaat bahasa dan lokasi sekolah di provinsi ini. Hal ini dilakukan untuk mendukung pelaksana pendidikan dalam mencari kebutuhan sekolah sesuai kurikulum, kekhawatiran bahasa, kehadiran siswa / guru, lokasi sekolah, dll (vi) Menetapkan tanggung jawab kabupaten di mana sebagian besar terdiri dari masyarakat pedesaan dan terpencil yang ada (Deiyai, Yahukimo , Pegunungan Bintang, Intan Jaya, Membramo, Nduga, Lanny Jaya, Yalimo dan Puncak), &nbsp;mengidentifikasi Divisi Bahasa dan Budaya Dikpora yang baru dibentuk untuk memulai pelaksanaan dewan sekolah berbasis masyarakat dan strategi pendidikan multibahasa dengan penggunaan bahasa ibu.</p>

<p><strong>Reformasi KPG</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Mendorong &nbsp;Kolese Pendidikan Guru (KPG) di Nabire, Merauke, Mimika (di Papua) dan Sarong (di Papua Barat) melatih guru untuk sekolah terpencil dan pedesaan</li>
	<li>Mendorong &nbsp;KPG bekerja sama dengan UNCEN sesuai dengan kurikulum UNCEN serta mengembangkan kurikulum khusus yang memperhatikan siswa pedesaan dan terpencil Papua.</li>
	<li>KPG dimaksudkan untuk melatih para guru sekolah dasar yang berkualitas untuk konteks Papua yang unik.</li>
	<li>Meninjau kembali kurikulum yang digunakan di KPG agar benar-benar &nbsp;sesuai dengan &nbsp;kebutuhan pendidikan yang dirasakan oleh guru sekolah di pedesaan dan terpencil Papua dan membuatnya &ldquo; khas Papua &rdquo;.</li>
	<li>Merestrukturisasi asrama KPG sehingga memiliki &ldquo; Rasa Keluarga Papua.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Guru juga harus dilatih dalam mengajar subjek ganda (pelajaran utama serta minor). Kebijakan baru pemerintah &nbsp;yang sedang dilaksanakan saat ini adalah: (i) menambah kuota jumlah siswa yang bisa masuk lembaga pendidikan guru (menanggapi jumlah kelebihan guru, rasio siswa - guru yang sangat rendah (STR 16: 1 ( SD) dan 13: 1 (SMP) 143), tetapi tidak merata, terutama untuk RRA yang memiliki banyak kekurangan, (ii) meningkatkan seleksi siswa; (iii) memberikan beasiswa bagi siswa yang mengambil profesi guru; dan (iv) memperkenalkan sistem&nbsp; mengajar rangkap.</p>

<p><strong>Ulasan Penggunaan TIK dan Potensinya</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Menghubungkan masyarakat pedesaan dan terpencil, sekolah dan pusat pembelajaran, untuk mengembangkan komunikasi modern dalam melakukan evaluasi intensif pada efektivitas program.</li>
	<li>Mendorong UNCEN atau (UT) Universitas Terbuka, untuk membuka jurusan Pendidikan Daerah Pedesaan dan Terpencil yang mendukung jalur karir guru pedesaan dan terpencil</li>
	<li>Informasi mengenai sekolah dan masyarakat terpencil dan terisolasi tanpa sekolah tidak dapat diandalkan, terutama di Papua, oleh karena itu perlu &nbsp;upaya untuk menggabungkan pengetahuan saat ini untuk mendapatkan gambaran yang multi-dimensi (misalnya lokasi sekolah dengan bahasa dan etnis atau suku.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pengembangan Model Sekolah Masyarakat Pedesaan dan Terpencil</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Pencampuran pendidikan formal, non - formal dan informal memunculkan model baru persekolahan seperti sekolah &nbsp;kampung yang menggunakan pendekatan yang berbeda dengan model asrama pada Model &ldquo; Pendidikan afirmatif &rdquo;. Penting untuk dapat bekerja sama dengan budaya, bahasa dan etnis yang beragam di seluruh / daerah terpencil pedesaan. Terlibat dalam masyarakat akan memastikan bahwa penyelenggaraan pendidikan (supply) sesuai dengan kebutuhan, keinginan dan manfaat yang diharapkan oleh &nbsp;komunitas-komunitas yang beragam tersebut (permintaan).</li>
	<li>SPM:
	<ul style=""list-style-type:circle"">
		<li>opsi untuk menentukan standar pelayanan minimum sekolah yang terletak di daerah pedesaan dan terpencil. Ada cukup kerangka peraturan untuk meninjau standar SPM untuk sekolah RRA</li>
		<li>kerangka ini ber upaya untuk menetapkan tingkat Standar lebih rendah dari yang ada di Pendidikan Nasional (SPN), yang berisi 700 indikator atau lebih (dalam 8 kategori / standar), merupakan standar yang tinggi dan tidak tidak realistis untuk sekolah-sekolah yang ada saat ini</li>
		<li>SPM memberikan &ldquo;patokan atau standar kinerja pelayanan pendidikan dasar yang diselenggarakan melalui sistem pendidikan formal dikelola oleh kabupaten / kota &rdquo; 147 terdiri dari 27 item yang meliputi indikator yang berkaitan dengan:
		<ul>
			<li>sekolah dasar dan madrasah (SD / MI) negeri dan swasta</li>
			<li>sekolah menengah Junior dan madrasah (SMP / MT) negeri dan swasta</li>
			<li>otoritas pendidikan lokal di tingkat kabupaten / kota, termasuk Kemeterian pendidikan (Kemendikbud) dan kantor-kantor lain di Kementerian Agama (Kemenag).</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>SPM &nbsp;saat ini tersedia di dua tingkat: untuk setiap sekolah (meliputi 13 standar yang terkait dengan fasilitas, guru, kurikulum, penilaian, jaminan mutu, dan manajemen sekolah) dan untuk setiap kabupaten (14 standar terkait fasilitas, guru, kurikulum, dan jaminan mutu) sebagai langkah pertama untuk mencapai SPN pada pendidikan dasar, yang meliputi sekolah dasar dan menengah pertama.</p>

<p><strong>Tata Kelola - Pengembangan Kapasitas</strong></p>

<p>Untuk meningkatkan tata kelola saat ini dalam sistem desentralisasi, reformasi yang bersifat luas dan kompleks perlu disertai dengan program pengembangan kapasitas yang signifikan. Tata Kelola diterapkan untuk dinas pendidikan dari mulai provinsi ke kabupaten, kecamatan ke tingkat sekolah, dan juga sistem yang lebih luas yang terlibat dalam proses pemerintahan. Misalnya, UNICEF bermitra dengan pemerintah provinsi dalam penyediaan bantuan teknis dan pelatihan tentang perencanaan yang merata dengan menggunakan pendekatan berbasis hak, meningkatkan penganggaran dan pengelolaan keuangan yang merata serta meningkatkan akuntabilitas pemerintah. Dua kebijakan signifikan yang akan berdampak pada permasalahan pemerintahan dan pemerataan adalah: (i) peningkatan alokasi dana Otonomi Khusus (Otsus) untuk kabupaten: saat ini dari 60% untuk kabupaten dan 40% untuk tingkat provinsi, 80 % untuk kabupaten dan 20% untuk provinsi. Dari anggaran 80% yang dialokasikan untuk kabupaten, jumlah yang digunakan untuk pendidikan menjadi kewenangan dari kabupaten (dialokasikan sesuai dengan kebutuhan). Tujuannya adalah untuk mempercepat penyediaan layanan di tingkat kabupaten. (ii) 5% dari 80% yang diberikan ke kabupaten akan dialokasikan untuk layanan pendidikan yang disediakan melalui yayasan keagamaan (yayasan). Hal ini dilakukan &nbsp;untuk mengatasi banyak kendala pendanaan yang dihadapi yayasan jika digunakan secara efektif.</p>

<p>Rencana Strategis menekankan prinsip penting, memulai dengan dialog yang efektif pada masyarakat di pedesaan dan terpencil Tanah Papua. Adanya kepastian bahwa penyediaan layanan pendidikan merespon permintaan masyarakat merupakan hal penting dalam rencana strategis ini. Pemerintah dituntut agar dapat memenuhi standar nasional pendidikan atau memenuhi pasar tenaga kerja dan keterampilan yang diharapkan untuk rencana pembangunan ekonomi seperti MP3EI untuk daerah. Sedangkan masyarakat adat memiliki tuntutan ter sendiri yang unik pada pendidikan yang berkaitan dengan persepsi mereka tentang manfaat (atau kadang-kadang ancaman budaya) pembelajaran untuk masyarakat.</p>

<p>Praktek global reformasi tata kelola dengan memperkenalkan desentralisasi sebagai metode meningkatkan pelayanan pendidikan mengidentifikasi berbagai strategi yang berkaitan dengan perencanaan, penganggaran, transparansi dan akuntabilitas, dan otonomi sekolah.</p>

"13","1","The Use of Mother Tongue Language as Instruction in Early Years of School ","<p>Generally we found children in remote and rural areas learn the least in classrooms. With the less educated teachers and shortages of resources that the schools are suffering, it reflected poor performance on assessments of learning such as the <a href=""http://www.epdc.org/data-about-epdc-data-epdc-learning-outcomes-data/egra-and-egma"" target=""_blank"">Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA)</a>.</p>

<p>We can take a look at Papua and West Papua, where children do not understand the language in which they are being taught. Millions of children across Indonesia have to leave their mother tongues behind in order to learn the national language, which is not familiar to them. This signifies an uncultivated resource children bring with them when starting school, their language skills, which leads to slower and poorer learning process.</p>

<p>Mother tongue based multilingual education (MTB-MLE) could improve learning in rural and remote areas. Teaching MTB-MLE also increases respect for and pride in the use of among mother tongues among children and communities, that reduces the feeling of being &lsquo;push out of the classroom&rsquo; and contribute to the goal of 12-year compulsory education.</p>

<p><strong>Mother-tongue instruction </strong></p>

	<li>Other than Indonesian and English in the standard curriculum, languages like Javanese, Balinese and Sundanese and other local languages in instruction are also used according to the region.</li>
	<li>There is an evidence that shows that children who have access to mother tongue based multilingual education (MTB-MLE) develop better language skills in their mother tongues and national languages and perform better in other subjects, such as mathematics, compared to those to taught in monolingual schools.</li>
	<li>MTB-MLE generally involves using mother tongues as the language of instruction in early grades and transitioning to instruction in the national language in later grades.</li>
	<li>Other benefits of MTB-MLE include lower dropout and grade repetition, increased parent interest and participation and the preservation of endangered and minority languages.</li>
	<li>Implementing MTB-MLE more widely in eastern Indonesia, especially in Papua, could significantly improve education outcomes and contribute to reducing gaps in enrolment and dropout between western and eastern Indonesia.</li>
	<li>Nationally, steps have been taken to introduce mother tongues in early-grade instruction. The RPJMN states that mother tongues should be used as the language of instruction until at least grade three of primary education where students do not understand the national language.</li>
	<li>In Papua, similar steps have been taken in Papua. Regional Regulation of Papua No. 3 states that, &ldquo;If Bahasa Indonesia cannot be used as the introductory language in delivering education, the local language can be used as the introductory language.&rdquo;</li>

","Penggunaan Bahasa Ibu dalam Pengajaran di Tingkat Awal Persekolahan","<p>Umumnya, anak-anak di daerah terpencil dan pedesaan belajar sedikit di dalam ruang kelas. Dengan guru yang berpendidikan rendah dan kekurangan sumber daya membuat sekolah menderita, seperti terlihat pada hasil &nbsp;penilaian membaca untuk tingkat kelas awal. Sebagai contoh, Papua dan Papua Barat, di mana anak-anak tidak mengerti bahasa pengantar pengajaran. Jutaan anak-anak di seluruh Indonesia harus meninggalkan bahasa ibu mereka di belakang untuk mempelajari bahasa nasional, yang tidak terbiasa bagi mereka. Hal ini memunculkan hambatan pada pengembangan kemampuan anak saat memulai sekolah, yakni kemampuan bahasa mereka, yang mengarah pada proses pembelajaran yang lambat dan buruk.</p>

<p>Pendidikan multibahasa dengan menggunakan bahasa ibu &nbsp;(MTB - MLE) dapat meningkatkan pembelajaran di daerah pedesaan dan terpencil. Selain itu pendekatan pembelajaran ini juga meningkatkan rasa hormat dan bangga dalam menggunakan bahasa ibu di kalangan anak-anak dan masyarakat, juga mengurangi perasaan &#39; terasing dari kelas &#39; dan memberikan kontribusi untuk pencapaian tujuan wajib belajar 12 &nbsp;tahun.</p>

	<li>The Comprehensive Situation Analysis (CSA) provides the situation evidence in Sumba primary schools to develop policy options. It also highlights the high repetition rate in Year 2 and a large amount of students having difficulties in reading. Repetition rate differs from 12% to 21% in the four districts and about 30% of Year 2 students have difficulties in reading in the sample schools. The high repetition rate and low reading abilities show low learning quality in the early grades. To monitor if students have the basic foundation for future learning, they need to take test in Year 2 or 3.</li>

<p>Students do better in listening to texts being read aloud in their mother tongue than in reading tests in Bahasa Indonesia. About 75% students were able to answer correctly more than 50% of the oral comprehension questions. Students who are not familiar with the language written structure and vocabulary, they use their speaking and listening ability in their mother tongue as the basic potential to develop reading comprehension. The study also found the <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=2"" target=""_blank"">early childhood education (PAUD)</a> value and the recognition of the need for quality provision to support school readiness.</p>

<p>All districts took important steps in policy development prioritizing three of the most important policy areas. which are (i) the continuous professional development for early grade teachers, especially in teaching literacy, through teacher working group (KKG); (ii) efforts towards equalized quality teachers distribution for disadvantaged schools; (iii) reforms of school principal recruitment.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Knowledge-to-Policy Practice in Sumba</li>
</ul>

<p>Forum Peduli Pendidikan Sumba&mdash;FPPS (Advocacy Forum for Sumba Education) was formed to play an important role in initiating Sumba&rsquo;s policy development. It made up of the Vice Bupati in each district, the head of the Dinas Pendidikan and Bappeda in each district as the line departments supporting the policy leaders in technical aspects. FPPS has the role of monitoring and coordinating the commitment of all districts to take policy action for education reform as well as to report on their policy adoption, resourcing, and regulation progress. FPPS has prepared official letters to the Minister of Education and Culture seeking for his support for the consideration of a set of policy adjustments.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Future of Education Policy Development in Sumba</li>
</ul>

<p>Now Sumba has dedicated a mechanism for policy review and development. The districts are trained for negotiating policy positions with the central government, even though resourcing and policy implementation requires systemic capacity as well as political drivers. For technical capacity, it needs a longer time frame for development, and there are some key processes that need to be in place to sustain the policies that districts have adopted:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Evaluation of schools and learning linked to systemic processes through the district Dinas Pendidikan, triggering intervention, strategy review, planning and budgeting</li>
	<li>Analysis of district&#39;s education financing</li>
	<li>Government-wide usage of Dapodik data, as the comprehensive source for planning and projections</li>
</ul>

<p>National policies that impact fiscal capacity of the districts must also be reviewed in order for the districts to adequately resource quality development. Other national policies, such as in the PAUD sector and the village fund allocation, may also require significant adjustment to yield the potential for improvement in educational quality.</p>

<p>Semua kabupaten melakukan langkah-langkah penting dalam pengembangan kebijakan dengan memprioritaskan tiga bidang kebijakan yang paling penting yaitu (i) pengembangan keprofesian berkelanjutan bagi guru kelas awal, terutama dalam mengajar keaksaraan, melalui kelompok kerja guru (KKG); (ii) upaya untuk menyebarkan guru berkualitas secara merata di sekolah-sekolah tertinggal; (Iii) merformasi rekrutmen kepala sekolah.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Praktek Pengetahuan-untuk-Kebijakan di Sumba</li>
</ul>

<p>Forum Peduli Pendidikan Sumba - FPPS didirikan untuk memainkan peran penting dalam membantu pengembangan kebijakan di Sumba. Forum ini terdiri dari Wakil Bupati dari setiap kabupaten, kepala Dinas Pendidikan dan Bappeda di setiap kabupaten untuk mendukung para pemimpin kebijakan dalam aspek teknis. FPPS memiliki peran memonitor dan mengkordinasikan komitmen semua kabupaten untuk ikut serta dalam reformasi pendidikan serta melaporkan perkembangan pengambilan kebijakan, pembiayaan, dan regulasinya. FPPS telah membuat surat resmi kepada Menteri Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan meminta bantuan untuk mempertimbangkan serangkaian penyesuaian pada kebijakan.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Masa Depan Pengembangan Kebijakan Pendidikan di Sumba</li>
</ul>

<p>Sekarang Sumba memiliki mekanisme untuk meninjau dan mengembangkan kebijakan. Kabupaten dilatih untuk menegosiasikan kedudukan &nbsp;kebijakan dengan pemerintah pusat, meskipun pembiayaan dan pelaksanaan kebijakan memerlukan kemampuan sistemik serta penggerak politik. Untuk kapasitas teknis, perlu kerangka waktu yang lebih lama untuk pengembangan, dan ada beberapa proses utama yang&nbsp; harus ada untuk mempertahankan kebijakan yang sudah digunakan oleh kabupaten:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Penilaian sekolah dan pembelajaran terkait dengan proses sistemik melalui Dinas Pendidikan daerah, yang memicu intervensi, tinjauan strategi, perencanaan dan penganggaran</li>
	<li>Analisis pembiayaan pendidikan kabupaten</li>
	<li>Pemerintah menggunakan data Dapodik sebagai sumber komprehensif untuk perencanaan dan proyeksi</li>
</ul>

<p>Kebijakan nasional yang berdampak pada &nbsp;kapasitas fiskal kabupaten juga harus ditinjau agar kabupaten dapat mengembangkan sumber daya yang berkualitas. Kebijakan nasional lainnya, seperti pada sektor PAUD dan alokasi dana desa, mungkin juga membutuhkan penyesuaian yang signifikan agar memiliki andil dalam peningkatan kualitas pendidikan.</p>

"15","1","Teacher Workforce Planning and Distribution","<p>A fair distribution of qualified teachers is a complex issue in Indonesia&rsquo;s educational system where private schools play an important role in educational provision, specifically in remote rural areas. In the past, most formal education was provided primarily by private faith-based organizations. Recognizing the importance of private provision in Indonesia&rsquo;s education system, the Government has sought to balance the quality of private and public education through several policy actions, including the BOS and placing PNS teachers in private schools. These PNS teachers are called &ldquo;guru PNS yang dipekerjakan&rdquo; (DPK teachers), DPK teachers make up half of the teachers. The proportion of PNS and non-PNS teachers in public and private schools varies by district. In the Sumba districts overall, 45% of teachers in government schools are PNS and 40% of teachers in private schools are PNS.</p>

	<li>In February 2016, the government of Pekalongan district Central Java withdrew DPK teachers, an action that received harsh criticism from the Forum for Private Education Institutions (Badan Musyawarah Perguruan Swasta or BMPS). Despite joint ministerial decrees in 2014 and a letter from the Minister of Education formalizing and supporting the placement of PNS teachers in private schools in mid-2016, this issue has been resurfacing.</li>
	<li>In mid-January of 2017, the Government made a public statement that would affect DPK teachers. The statement described the Government&rsquo;s intention to reinforce <a href=""http://www.batan.go.id/prod_hukum/extern/pp53.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Government Regulation 53/2010</a> strictly. This regulation restricts PNS to serve in government entities exclusively. When applied to teachers, the impact would be to deploy them to government schools instead.</li>
	<li>Re-deploying DPK teachers to government schools will adversely affect the <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=15"" target=""_blank"">3T areas</a> (predominantly outermost, isolated, underdeveloped areas), as may be demonstrated by the case of Central Sumba where the mandate would translate to the district losing half of the teachers in their private schools.</li>
	<li>This most recent public statement directing PNS teachers to return to government schools is the latest iteration of similar statements in a string of central and local governments&rsquo; inconsistencies on messages to the public regarding DPK teachers. It signals perhaps an ongoing policy conversation and debate over how to interpret regulatory frameworks governing the distribution of PNS teachers, and what sectoral adjustments are needed.</li>
	<li>There are inconsistencies in policies emanating from different levels in the hierarchy of legal products: government regulations or Peraturan Pemerintah, Laws or Undang-Undang, and Ministerial Decrees or Peraturan Menteri. This gives the impression that ministries are pulling in different directions on the issue. It has created confusion at the district level that is exacerbated by rumors, misinterpretation of public statements, and a tendency to take public statements as new regulations.</li>

<p>There is a need for clarity on the placement of PNS teachers in private schools at the policy, legal, and regulatory levels. More importantly, there is a need for careful consideration regarding how the legal and regulatory framework pertaining to PNS teacher management and distribution will be interpreted at the local level. The risk is that rigid application of overall PNS management policies to DPK teachers will doubly disadvantage children in rural remote areas. Those children are already disadvantaged simply by residing in resource poor areas. To withdraw qualified teachers from their schools would further deprive them of one resource that could help them to improve their lives now and in the future.</p>

","Perencanaan dan Penyebaran Tenaga Kerja Guru","<p>Penyebaran guru&nbsp; yang berkualitas secara merata&nbsp; merupakan masalah yang kompleks pada sistem pendidikan di Indonesia di mana sekolah swasta memainkan peran penting dalam penyediaan pendidikan, khususnya di daerah pedesaan terpencil. Di masa lalu, sebagian besar pendidikan formal diberikan terutama oleh organisasi swasta berbasis keagamaan. Mengingat pentingnya penyediaan sistem pendidikan swasta di Indonesia, Pemerintah berupaya untuk menyeimbangkan kualitas pendidikan swasta dan negeri melalui beberapa langkah kebijakan, termasuk BOS dan menempatkan guru PNS di sekolah swasta. Guru-guru PNS ini disebut &ldquo; guru PNS Yang dipekerjakan &rdquo; ( DPK guru), guru DPK berjumlah setengah dari guru. Proporsi PNS dan non - guru PNS di sekolah negeri dan swasta bervariasi tiap kabupaten. Di kabupaten Sumba keseluruhan, 45% guru di sekolah-sekolah pemerintah berstatus&nbsp; PNS dan 40% guru di sekolah swasta adalah PNS.</p>

	<li>Pada bulan Februari 2016, Pemerintah Kabupaten Pekalongan Jawa Tengah melakukan penarikan guru DPK, tindakan yang mendapat kritik keras dari Badan Musyawarah Perguruan Swasta atau BMPS). Meskipun keputusan menteri bersama pada tahun 2014 dan surat Menteri Pendidikan memformalkan dan mendukung penempatan guru PNS di sekolah swasta pada pertengahan 2016, masalah ini telah muncul lagi.</li>
	<li>Pada pertengahan Januari 2017, Pemerintah membuat pernyataan yang mempengaruhi guru DPK. Pernyataan itu menggambarkan niat Pemerintah untuk melaksanakan Peraturan Pemerintah Nomor 53/2010 dengan ketat. Peraturan ini membatasi PNS untuk kerja di lembaga pemerintah secara eksklusif. Bila diterapkan, dampaknya akan menempatkan guru di sekolah-sekolah negeri.</li>
	<li>Penarikan guru DPK kembali ke sekolah-sekolah negeri akan mempengaruhi daerah 3T (terutama terluar, terpencil, daerah tertinggal), sebagaimana contoh kasus Sumba Tengah di mana kebijakan ini mengakibatkan kabupaten kehilangan setengah dari guru dari sekolah swasta.</li>
	<li>Pernyataan pemerintah yang meminta guru PNS untuk kembali ke sekolah negeri merupakan iterasi terbaru pernyataan serupa yang menunjukan inkonsistensi serangkaian pernyataan pemerintah pusat dan daerah kepada masyarakat mengenai guru DPK. Ini menunjukan adanya pembicaraan dan perdebatan kebijakan yang sedang berlangsung tentang kerangka peraturan yang mengatur penyebaran guru PNS, dan penyesuaian yang diperlukan.</li>
	<li>Ada inkonsistensi kebijakan yang berasal dari tingkat hirarki produk hukum yang berbeda: Peraturan Pemerintah, Hukum atau Undang-Undang, dan Keputusan Menteri atau Peraturan Menteri. Hal ini memberikan kesan bahwa kementerian memiliki arah yang berbeda pada masalah ini.

<p>Pilihan yang diusulkan meliputi kebutuhan kejelasan, hukum, dan tingkat regulasi untuk kebijakan penempatan guru PNS di sekolah swasta. Lebih penting lagi, ada kebutuhan untuk melihat bagaimana kerangka hukum dan peraturan yang berkaitan dengan manajemen dan distribusi guru PNS yang diterapkan di tingkat lokal. Risiko penerapan kebijakan manajemen PNS yang kaku tentang guru DPK menempatkan anak-anak di daerah terpencil pedesaan di posisi yang kurang menguntungkan. Anak-anak dirugikan hanya karena berada di daerah miskin sumber daya. Menarik guru berkualitas dari sekolah mereka akan lebih menjauhkan mereka dari sumber daya yang dapat membantu mereka memperbaiki kehidupan mereka sekarang dan&nbsp; di masa depan.</p>

<p>Two aspects of PPP considered effective are <em>Nomor Unik Kepala Sekolah</em> (NUKS), an official principal registration number, and PPP mentoring program. Teachers who successfully complete professional learning will receive a NUKS, which indicates a teacher as eligible to become school principal. NUKS is considered prestigious and clear in terms of standards. Mentoring program, on the other hand, is conducted in part by Master Trainers, who are trained, accredited and employed by <a href=""http://lppks.kemdikbud.go.id/"" target=""_blank"">LPPKS</a> (principal development instituition).</p>

	<li>In terms of PPP, unfortunately, the degree of political and bureaucratic involvement in identifying applicants into PPP and in the appointment of school principals was a problem.&nbsp; However, based on data from LPPKS, only between 1.2% and 2.1% of all principals had a NUKS in 2014/2015.</li>

","Efektivitas Kepala Sekolah","<p>Kepala sekolah teladan merupakan faktor penting dalam meningkatkan efektivitas dan peningkatan mutu&nbsp; sekolah. Peraturan Menteri Indonesia&nbsp; nomor 44/2002 mengeluarkan tentang manajemen&nbsp; berbasis sekolah, yang menempatkan kepala sekolah sebagai pembuat keputusan utama&nbsp; misalnya dalam urusan keuangan dan penganggaran, manajemen staf, perencanaan sekolah, dan peran pengembangan kurikulum. Karenanya kepala sekolah harus senantiasa meningkatkan keterampilannya. Program Persiapan Kepala Sekolah (PPKS) diadakan untuk memastikan mereka yang memenuhi syarat menjadi kepala sekolah adalah yang siap untuk pekerjaan itu. Program ini memiliki tujuan: koherensi antara konten dan tujuan, keseimbangan antara teori dan praktek, kriteria penerimaan yang tepat, dan fokus pada penilaian berkelanjutan.</p>

<p>Dua aspek PPKS yang dianggap penting yaitu Nomor Unik Kepala Sekolah (NUKS), sebuah nomor resmi pendaftaran kepala sekolah, dan program mentoring PPKS. Guru yang berhasil menyelesaikan pembelajaran profesi akan menerima NUKS, sebagai bukti bahwa guru memenuhi syarat untuk menjadi kepala sekolah. NUKS dianggap penting dan jelas menurut standar. Program mentoring, di sisi lain, dilakukan sebagian oleh Master Trainer, yang terlatih, terakreditasi dan dipekerjakan oleh LPPKS.</p>

<p>The key challenge suggested by many publications on school supervision in Indonesia is the recruitment process. Some suggested that supervisors should have experience in school leadership positions.</p>

<p>A 2013 by the <a href=""http://www.acdp-indonesia.org/en/home/"" target=""_blank"">Education Sector Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP)</a> survey of supervisors and principals validated that supervisors were deficient in competencies needed to improve learning. The survey rated supervisors (through self-ratings and ratings by teachers and principals) on, among others, personality/character, social (taking an active role in the supervisors&rsquo; association, etc.), and managerial as well as academic supervision.</p>

<p>Points of challenges identified through the survey:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Supervisors generally were rated high in &ldquo;Social&rdquo; and &ldquo;Personality&rdquo; dimensions of competencies and low in &ldquo;Research&rdquo; and &ldquo;Academic Supervision&rdquo;, with considerable variation between regions.</li>
	<li>Field studies showed that a significant proportion of supervisors had little understanding about the content of <a href=""http://bsnp-indonesia.org/?page_id=61"" target=""_blank"">National Education Standards</a> or how such standards could be used to benefit schools and student learning.</li>
	<li>Though the survey suggests that participation in INPRES training did have a positive impact on supervisor competency, more research needs to be done to determine whether training leads to improvement in education quality and student learning outcome.</li>
	<li>The survey also revealed that supervisors undertook minimal continued professional development (CPD) training in the three years prior to the study.</li>

<p><a href=""http://www.acdp-indonesia.org"" target=""_blank"">ACDP</a> has also identified certain effective practices from other Asian countries that are also going through decentralization processes. Malaysia has been developing a more critical supervision system or school &ldquo;audit&rdquo; that is carried out by a team inspectors located external to the school which regularly visits and inspects schools. This type of supervision system is based on the one set up by the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted"" target=""_blank"">Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED)</a> in the late 1980s in England and Wales. The Republic of Korea also uses &ldquo;external&rdquo; evaluators from the provincial and metropolitan offices of education who are located outside of the school to administer school evaluations. While Malaysia&rsquo;s system covers the whole operation of the school, Korea&rsquo;s uses appointed evaluation committees that do not follow uniform criteria. Both systems send the results of evaluations to the government, and, in the case of Korea, use results to financially reward well-performing schools.</p>

<p>In contrast, countries like Kenya, Bangladesh and Nigeria have placed more focus on the supervisor&rsquo;s role in supporting and developing teachers instead of their role in inspecting and critically evaluating. These countries have adopted the premise that &ldquo;control without support will not lead to quality improvement&rdquo;. Bangladesh and Kenya expect supervisors to have many roles such as that of head teachers; classroom teachers; guides and counselors to teachers; liaison between the school; the community and external agencies; a key organizer of school functioning; and as administrator and academic planner.</p>

<p>Many countries such as the Philippines, Chile and Australia are attempting to develop a system of supervision that is both critical and supportive. For example, each school in Victoria, Australia, annually prepares a self-assessment report by collecting, analyzing and reporting certain data. During this process, school principals work closely with teachers to improve the teaching learning process. Critical inspection occurs every three years by external firms that evaluate the school&rsquo;s performance, report to the government and send recommendations to schools.</p>

<p>Permasalahan utama yang banyak disebut&nbsp; dalam berbagai publikasi mengenai pengawasan sekolah di Indonesia adalah proses perekrutan. Beberapa menyarankan bahwa pengawas harus memiliki pengalaman di posisi kepemimpinan sekolah.</p>

<p>Survey&nbsp;&nbsp; ACDP tahun 2013 pada pengawas dan kepala sekolah mengungkapkan bahwa pengawas kurang memiliki kompetensi dalam peningkatan pembelajaran. Survei menilai pengawas pada &nbsp;(melalui penilaian diri dan peringkat oleh guru dan kepala sekolah), antara lain, kepribadian / karakter, sosial (berperan peran aktif dalam asosiasi pengawas, dll), dan manajerial serta pengawasan akademik.</p>

<p>Beberpa tantangan yang diidentifikasi melalui survei:</p>

<ul>
	<li>pengawas biasanya dinilai&nbsp; tinggi dalam dimensi&nbsp; kompetensi&nbsp; &ldquo;Sosial &rdquo; dan &ldquo; Pribadi &rdquo; dan rendah&nbsp; dalam dimensi&nbsp; &ldquo; Penelitian &rdquo; dan &ldquo; Pengawasan Akademik &rdquo; , dengan variasi yang cukup besar antar daerah.</li>
	<li>Penelitian lapangan menunjukan bahwa sebagian besar pengawas juga memiliki sedikit pemahaman tentang isi dari Standar Nasional Pendidikan atau bagaimana standar tersebut dapat digunakan untuk kepentingan sekolah dan belajar siswa.</li>
	<li>Meskipun survei menunjukkan bahwa partisipasi dalam pelatihan INPRES&nbsp; memiliki dampak positif pada kompetensi pengawas, penelitian lebih lanjut perlu dilakukan untuk menentukan apakah pelatihan berpengaruh pada peningkatan kualitas pendidikan dan hasil belajar siswa.</li>
	<li>Survei tersebut juga mengungkapkan bahwa pengawas mengikuti pelatihan pengembangan keprofesian &nbsp;berkelanjutan (PKB) minimal tiga tahun sebelum penelitian.</li>

<p>Sebagai pengganti persyaratan Peraturan Menteri 21/2010 untuk posisi pengawas yang akan diselenggarakan hanya oleh guru dengan status pegawai negeri sipil, ada beberapa yang menyarankan agar atasan memiliki pengalaman kepemimpinan di sekolah sebelumnya.</p>

<p>ACDP juga telah mengidentifikasi beberapa praktik efektif dari negara-negara Asia lainnya yang juga melalui proses desentralisasi. Malaysia telah mengembangkan sistem pengawasan yang lebih kritis atau &quot;audit&quot; sekolah yang dilakukan oleh inspektur tim yang berada di luar sekolah yang secara teratur mengunjungi dan memeriksa sekolah. Jenis sistem pengawasan ini didasarkan pada yang ditetapkan oleh Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) pada akhir 1980an di Inggris dan Wales. Republik Korea juga menggunakan evaluator &quot;eksternal&quot; dari dinas pendidikan provinsi dan metropolitan yang berada di luar sekolah untuk mengelola evaluasi sekolah. Sementara sistem Malaysia mencakup keseluruhan operasi sekolah, komite evaluasi yang ditunjuk oleh Korea menggunakan kriteria yang tidak sesuai. Kedua sistem mengirimkan hasil evaluasi kepada pemerintah, dan, dalam kasus Korea, menggunakan hasil untuk memberi penghargaan finansial kepada sekolah berkinerja baik.</p>

<p>Sebaliknya, negara-negara seperti Kenya, Bangladesh dan Nigeria telah lebih fokus pada peran pengawas dalam mendukung dan mengembangkan guru, bukan peran mereka dalam memeriksa dan mengevaluasi secara kritis. Negara-negara ini telah mengadopsi premis bahwa &quot;kontrol tanpa dukungan tidak akan mengarah pada peningkatan kualitas&quot;. Bangladesh dan Kenya mengharapkan pengawas memiliki banyak peran seperti kepala sekolah; Guru kelas; Panduan dan konselor untuk guru; Hubungan antara sekolah; Masyarakat dan lembaga eksternal; Penyelenggara utama fungsi sekolah; Dan sebagai administrator dan perencana akademis.</p>

<p>Banyak negara seperti Filipina, Cile dan Australia mencoba mengembangkan sistem pengawasan yang sangat penting dan mendukung. Misalnya, setiap sekolah di Victoria, Australia, setiap tahun menyiapkan laporan penilaian mandiri dengan mengumpulkan, menganalisis dan melaporkan data tertentu. Selama proses ini, kepala sekolah bekerja sama dengan guru untuk memperbaiki proses belajar mengajar. Pemeriksaan kritis terjadi setiap tiga tahun oleh perusahaan eksternal yang mengevaluasi kinerja sekolah, melapor kepada pemerintah dan mengirimkan rekomendasi ke sekolah.</p>

"18","1","Continuous Professional Development","<p>Indonesia is currently reforming its national education system, presenting the opportunity to promote the development of 21st century skills to compete with other countries (particularly in the ASEAN region). In order to effectively teach those skills, teachers must be equipped with a rich repertoire/plan in learning strategies, an inÃ¢â‚¬Âdepth understanding on how learning is delivered, an ability to work collaboratively, strong technology skills, and the ability to use technology as tools to enhance learning. A framework and mechanism are needed to facilitate the continuous teacher development (CPD). <a href=""http://multisite.itb.ac.id/sa/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2016/03/UU_14_2005.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Law 14/2005 on Teachers and Lecturers</a> and <a href=""https://luk.staff.ugm.ac.id/atur/bsnp/Permendiknas16-2007KompetensiGuru.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Ministerial Regulation 16/2007</a> have required teachers to possess academic qualifications and to master competency standards. Indonesia presently has 33 quality assurance agencies and 12 national centers for subject training, which are responsible for the inÃ¢â‚¬Âservice training for teachers.</p>

<p>Teacher Working Groups (Primary School Teacher Cluster or <em>Kelompok Kerja Guru</em>/KKG) and Secondary School Subject Teacher Cluster or <em>Musyawarah Guru Mata Pelajaran</em>/MGMP) has been recognized as the most appropriate and effective path which most teachers can take in receiving CPD. It provides a forum for teachers to discuss and work together in developing curriculum, lesson plans, teaching practice and other issues including teaching students with special needs or teaching students using their mother tongue.</p>

<p>An alternative form that has a similar strategy to <a href=""/collection-detail.php?lang=1&amp;link=collection&amp;id=82"" target=""_blank"">KKGs and MGMPs</a> is called the &ldquo;Smart Teacher&rdquo; online platform (<em>Guru Pintar Online</em>/GPO) which is managed by Indonesia&rsquo;s Open University (<em>Universitas Terbuka</em>/UT). GPO is an online forum or media, which opens the opportunities for teachers to help one another by sharing best practices and materials beyond their local teacher working groups. There are also platforms provided by The Center of Information and Communication Technology in Education and Culture (<em>Pusat Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan</em>) under MoEC, which include online, television and radio, where teachers can draw learning and teaching materials. One of the platforms is called the Rumah Belajar, which allows teachers to create and share their teaching materials with others and it is also linked to the online portal of CPD.</p>

	<li>CPD in Indonesia still requires significant improvement. A review by OECD reveals that many teachers do not receive any CPD and, moreover, receive little professional guidance by external facilitators, principals, supervisors, or even mentoring by experienced teachers.</li>
	<li>In Indonesia the current teaching working groups are yet to be considered as providing the expected results because KKGs and MGMPs still have many issues and problems. A study by the World Bank found that there are only a small percentage of teachers that have developed their skills through teacher working groups, for example: (i) knowledge and skills of teaching practice (50% teachers in KKG and 45% teachers in MGMP); and (ii) knowledge and skills of Classroom Action Research (33% teachers in KKG and 32% teachers in MGMP).</li>

	<li>The critical weakness can be addressed by providing CPD programs related to the teacher qualification process.</li>
	<li>Teacher working groups such as KKGs/MGMPs would provide better outcomes if they: (i) help teachers focus on providing more effective learning for students; (ii) use evidenceÃ¢â‚¬Âbased reviews from research and data on student learning outcomes; (iii) support teachers to review and adapt their teaching practice according to its impact on student learning; (iv) are clearly linked with school improvement, planning and management initiatives; (v) restructure the curriculum of the of the CPD given in these groups by strengthening the focus on Lesson Study and building coherence around Classroom Action Research (CAR), and (vi) support them through strong leadership of school principals and by skilled external facilitators. Skilled facilitators (<em>guru pemandu</em>) Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Â who could be trained and experienced school principals Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬Â could support local KKG and MGMP by revitalizing inactive clusters or encourage establishment of new clusters in other areas.</li>

Facilitators were also trained to plan interesting activities for teachers and to use the results of teacher selfÃ¢â‚¬Âassessment in teacher working groups.

<p>Substantial body of research has found that teachers are one of the most important in-school factors in improving student learning. To have a quality teaching, teachers must first and foremost be present in the classroom. High rates of teacher absence would affect the students, other teachers and operations of schools, as described in the following non-extensive list:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>In unattended classes students were considerably more likely to be left without a prescribed activity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The student absence rate was higher in schools with a high teacher absence rate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>There was some evidence that higher rates of teacher absence in primary schools were associated with lower student achievement in mathematics.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Around two-thirds of classes without their regularly scheduled teacher had a substitute. Most substitutes were assigned to more than one class during one lesson period.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In secondary schools, only about 40% of substitutes were teachers of the same subject matter as the regularly scheduled teacher.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Of classes that were in session during the unannounced visits, 9% were unattended for the duration of the class and a further 5% of classes were temporarily unattended, with the teacher later returning to class.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>When unattended classes are taken into account, primary schools are estimated to provide an average of only 19 hours teaching per week and secondary schools only 23 hours per week. These are significantly below the <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=43"" target=""_blank"">Minimum Service Standards</a> requirements.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Teacher absenteeism rate in Indonesia has decreased from 19% in 2003 to 10% in 2013 and the estimate of teacher absence from school in 2013 is generally lower than the estimates of absence rates in few other developing countries. However, the 10% rate of teacher absence is still considered high, and the teacher absence rate from class is higher than the teacher absence rate from school.</p>

<p>Among different regions, types of teachers and types of schools, teacher absence rates vary widely. This suggests that policies which seek to change the conditions of schools may be effective in reducing absenteeism. Teacher absence rates were found to be generally higher:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Among male teachers</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Among teachers who worked at more than one school</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=3"" target=""_blank"">remote schools</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In schools with poor physical facilities</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In schools that had not achieved the particular <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=43"" target=""_blank"">Minimum Service Standards (MSS)</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In schools where the school leader was not present or did not provide a positive role model for teachers</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In schools where there had not been a recent visit from the district education office</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In schools where the school committee had little engagement</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The most common reason for absence was due to attending official teaching-related duties, largely due to attending meetings and trainings. There were also significant regional differences as to the reasons teachers are absent. Furthermore, most frequently, regardless of whether or not they were scheduled to teach, teachers - who were at school but not teaching &ndash; were doing neither academic nor administrative activities. Only one in four teachers who were absent from class were found engaged in another academic activity, such as designing teaching materials or assessing students&rsquo; work.</p>

<p>At the national level, policy priorities include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Reconsidering the current national policies on teachers&rsquo; working hours, so as to reduce the incentive for teachers to work at more than one school.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Expanding the current standards concerning the expectations of teachers to include their non-teaching time and responsibilities. There is a need for the non-class teaching role of teachers to be clarified and for the environment of schools to better encourage and support teachers to use their time outside of class in ways that are more rewarding for students.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Continuing to address the broader issues of the distribution of teachers in the system. Teacher absence from school was not found to be caused by teacher shortages. Instead, as this and other studies have concluded, it is one of the symptoms of a broader challenge of the inequitable distribution of teachers in the Indonesian education system.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>At the district level, policy priorities include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Strengthening support and supervision of the teaching and learning process. Regular and focused visits by district-level officials help reinforce the importance of teachers&rsquo; work, and indicate an efficiently operating district in which a range of actions that directly and indirectly encourage teacher attendance are underway.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Increasing the focus on supporting schools in recording and tracking absence levels. A fingerprinting machine is only one way to do this, and the introduction of such machines without broader changes at the district level is unlikely to achieve the desired result.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>At the school level, policy priorities include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Strengthening principal selection and competency development as a key to promoting a &ldquo;presence and engagement culture&rdquo; among teachers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Providing schools with clear policies and support for managing teacher absences and substitute teachers in ways that minimize the impact on students.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Providing schools with more support to improve the management of school schedules and teachers&rsquo; roles to make the most of teachers&rsquo; time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Building more constructive engagement by schools with their local communities.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Wherever possible holding meetings and training days outside of regular school teaching hours.</li>

<p>Banyak penelitian menemukan bahwa guru merupakan salah satu faktor paling penting dalam sekolah untuk meningkatkan pembelajaran siswa. Untuk memiliki kualitas pengajaran, guru pertama dan utama harus hadir di kelas. Tingginya tingkat ketidakhadiran guru akan mempengaruhi siswa, guru lain dan operasi sekolah, seperti yang dijelaskan dalam daftar non-ekstensif berikut:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Di kelas tanpa pengawasan baiasanya dibiarkan tanpa tugas.</li>
	<li>Tingkat siswa yng tidak hadir di sekolah lebih tinggi daripada tingkat ketidakhadiran guru.</li>
	<li>Bukti menunjukan tingkat ketidakhadiran guru lebih tinggi di sekolah dasar dan mengakibatkan prestasi siswa yang rendah dalam matematika.</li>
	<li>Sekitar dua pertiga kelas tanpa guru yang seharusnya mengajar memiliki pengganti. Kebanyakan pengganti ditugaskan lebih dari satu kelas selama satu periode pelajaran.</li>
	<li>Di sekolah menengah, hanya sekitar 40% dari pengganti adalah guru dari mata pelajaran yang sama dari guru yang seharusnya mengajar.</li>
	<li>Dari kelas yang dikunjungi selama kunjungan, 9% tanpa pengawasan selama kelas berlangsung dan 5%&nbsp; kelas tanpa pengawasan untuk sementara waktu, diman guru kemudian kembali ke kelas.</li>
	<li>Ketika kelas tanpa pengawasan dimasukan, rata-rata hanya 19 jam mengajar per minggu di sekolah dasar dan hanya 23 jam per minggu di sekolah menengah. Jam mengajar ini jauh di bawah persyaratan Standar Pelayanan minimum.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tingkat ketidakhadiran guru di Indonesia mengalami penurunan dari 19% pada tahun 2003 menjadi 10% pada tahun 2013 dan pada tahun 2013 tingkat ketidakhadiran guru dari sekolah umumnya lebih rendah dibanding dengan tingkat ketidakhadiran di beberapa negara berkembang lainnya. Namun, 10% ketidakhadiran guru masih dianggap tinggi, dan tingkat ketidakhadiran guru di kelas yang lebih tinggi dari tingkat ketidakhadiran guru di sekolah.</p>

<p>Di berbagai daerah, jenis guru dan jenis sekolah, tingkat ketidakhadiran guru bervariasi. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa kebijakan untuk mengubah kondisi sekolah efektif dalam mengurangi ketidakhadiran. Tingkat ketidakhadiran guru umumnya ditemukan lebih tinggi:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Di antara guru laki-laki</li>
	<li>Di antara guru yang bekerja di lebih dari satu sekolah</li>
	<li>Di sekolah terpencil</li>
	<li>Di sekolah dengan fasilitas fisik yang buruk</li>
	<li>Di sekolah yang belum mencapai Standar Pelayanan Minimum tertentu (MSS)</li>
	<li>Di sekolah di mana pemimpin sekolah tidak hadir atau tidak memberikan model peran positif bagi para guru</li>
	<li>Di sekolah yang belum menerima kunjungan dari dinas pendidikan kabupaten</li>
	<li>Di sekolah di mana komite sekolah tidak terlalu terlibat</li>
</ul>

<p>Alasan paling umum ketidakhadiran ialah karena menghadiri tugas resmi terkait pengajaran, seperti menghadiri rapat dan pelatihan. Ada juga perbedaan regional yang signifikan mengapa guru tidak hadir. Selain itu, paling sering, terlepas dari apakah mereka punya jadwal mengajar atau tidak, guru - yang ada&nbsp; di sekolah tetapi tidak mengajar - melakukan kegiatan diluar kegiatan akademis maupun administratif. Hanya satu dari empat guru yang absen dari kelas yang ditemukan terlibat dalam kegiatan akademik lain, seperti penyusunan bahan ajar atau penilaian kinerja siswa.</p>

<p>Di tingkat nasional, prioritas kebijakan meliputi:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mempertimbangkan kembali kebijakan nasional saat ini tentang jam kerja guru, sehingga dapat mengurangi insentif bagi guru yang bekerja lebih dari satu sekolah.</li>
	<li>Memperluas standar mengenai keinginan guru untuk memasukkan waktu non-mengajar dan tanggung jawab mereka. Kebutuhan peran guru di luar mengajar harus diperjelas dan lingkungan sekolah harus lebih mendorong dan membantu guru menggunakan waktu mereka di luar kelas dengan cara yang lebih bermanfaat bagi siswa.</li>
	<li>Terus berupaya menangani permasalahan yang lebih luas tentang penyebaran guru dalam sistem. Guru tidak hadir bukan disebabkan karena kekurangan guru. Sebaliknya, karena hal ini dan lainnya penelitian telah menyimpulkan, ketidakhadiran ini merupakan gejala munculnya tantangan yang lebih luas dari sekedar penyebaran guru yang merata dalam sistem pendidikan di Indonesia.</li>
</ul>

<p>Di tingkat kabupaten, prioritas kebijakan meliputi:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Penguatan dukungan dan pengawasan pada proses pengajaran dan pembelajaran. Kunjungan teratur dan khusus dari pejabat tingkat kabupaten membantu memperkuat pentingnya kinerja guru, dan menunjukkan pelaksanaan yang efisien di mana ada upaya yang secara langsung dan tidak langsung mendorong kehadiran guru.</li>
	<li>Meningkatkan upaya untuk membantu sekolah dengan merekam dan melacak tingkat ketidakhadiran. Mesin sidik jari merupakan salah satu cara untuk melakukannya, dan penggunaan mesin tersebut tanpa perubahan di tingkat kabupaten tidak mungkin dapat mencapai hasil yang diinginkan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Di tingkat sekolah, prioritas kebijakan meliputi:</p>

<ul>
	<li>penguatan pemilihan dan pengembangan kompetensi kepala sekolah sebagai kunci untuk mempromosikan &ldquo;budaya kehadiran dan keterlibatan&rdquo; antara guru</li>
	<li>menyediakan kebijakan dan dukungan yang jelas untuk mengelola absensi guru dan guru pengganti agar dampak pada siswa minimal.</li>
	<li>Memberikan lebih banyak dukungan bagi sekolah untuk meningkatkan pengelolaan jadwal sekolah dan peran guru untuk memaksimalkan sebagian besar waktu guru.</li>
	<li>Membangun keterlibatan sekolah yang lebih konstruktif dengan masyarakat setempat.</li>
	<li>Sedapat mungkin mengadakan hari untuk pertemuan dan pelatihan di luar jam mengajar pada sekolah reguler.</li>

<p dir=""ltr""><u>School Operational Assistance (BOS)</u></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In 2005, the BOS scheme was introduced and it had the largest impact at school level across the country. The government also provided BOS funds for primary and junior secondary schools since August 2005. In 2010/11 it covered around 43 million students in 216,191 public and private primary also junior secondary schools and madrasah. In 2012, the government allocated Rp 23 trillion for BOS funding, by 2013 BOS will be provided to senior secondary schools. This resulted in a significant increase of access for disadvantaged families. In 2009, the <a href=""http://data.uis.unesco.org/"" target=""_blank"">gross enrollment rate (GER)</a> at primary school level has increased to 93.8%, and at junior secondary level the GER has raised from 52% in 2006 to 59% in 2009. BOS also helped raise the grade passing rate from 50% to 55% on the same period.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The plan of BOS funds for school operational costs is the most significant policy initiative, which is valuable for schools in poorer, more remote areas that often lack of any operational budget. &nbsp;However, BOS has decreased community participation in education because of parents&rsquo; perception that BOS covers all costs. &nbsp;Also, parents are still asked to make other financial contributions for infrastructure, equipment, and extracurricular expenses.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><u>One Roof Primary and Junior Secondary Schools</u></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">A key component of of MoEC and MoRA&rsquo;s strategic plan is to combine&nbsp;primary and junior secondary school (one-roof). Despite the fact that this has been an important strategy for increasing equitable access, particularly in remote area, it does not guarantee the learning quality provided; as teachers in many on-roof schools are primary school teachers. Some of these teachers only have a two-year primary teacher training (PGSD) degree and even lack competency in certain subjects for junior secondary schools.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><u>School Rehabilitation</u></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Since the refurbishment process has been self-managed by the schools, this program has helped to enhance school-based management, with the involvement of school committees and parents. By doing so, it has made a significant contribution to improving learning environments.</p>

<p>There is an increasing number of positive trends within basic education in Indonesia, exceptionally in terms of improving access to primary and junior secondary education. Meanwhile, the gaps still persist and much remains to be done to fully achieve Renstra targets and EFA goals by 2015.</p>

<p><u>Access and Enrollments</u></p>

<p>Alongside the nine-year compulsory basic education policy, Indonesia has almost achieved universal access to primary level and compelling increases in enrollments for junior secondary level. Nevertheless, this achievements veil regional and socio-economic inequality.</p>

<p>Primary level: Since the 1980&rsquo;s, the primary enrollment rate has gradually increased. Reflected in both the net enrollment rate (NER) for primary level (95.5% in 2011/12), likewise the gross enrollment rate (GER) (115.4% for the same year). Although it shows that Indonesia is on track to achieve the Renstra target of an NER of 96% for primary level by 2014, the leveling off of both NER and GER is presumably due to the difficulty in providing access for all children, particularly those in remote areas.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.unesco.org/gem-report/report/2011/hidden-crisis-armed-conflict-and-education#sthash.ADSfZGYq.dpbs"" target=""_blank"">The UNESCO 2011 Global Monitoring Report</a> calculated Gender Parity Index (GPI) for primary school level at 0.97. This indicates that overall opportunity to obtain and complete primary education is almost equal for boys and girls at this level. However inequality still exists in some areas, especially in Eastern Indonesia.</p>

<p>Junior Secondary level: In 1994 the government initiated the &lsquo;Nine-Year Compulsory Education&rsquo; program which significantly increase junior secondary enrollment. Between 2000 - 2009, there was approximately a 44% increase in the number of junior secondary schools. BOS to junior secondary schools since 2005 and subsidies for poor students have also contributed to a substantial increase in enrollment rates. It can be seen in the increase in NER, from 58.6% to 77.7% (2001-2012), close to achieving the Rensta target of 76.8% by the end of 2014. The GER also reflected the improvements, which increased from 76.1% to 99.5% (2001-2012).</p>

<p><a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=6"" target=""_blank"">Islamic schools</a>: As madrasah mostly serves poor rural community, it considerably contributes to the education in Indonesia towards nine-year compulsory basic education. In 2010/11, there are 22,527 Madrasah Ibtidaiyah (MI) serving 3,082,226 students (10.1% of the total enrollments for primary level) throughout the country. Along with 14,022 Madrasah Tsanawiyah (MT) - the equivalent of junior secondary level -, serving 2,587,106 students. Islamic boarding school (pondok pesantren) is the primary and junior secondary equivalency packages introduced by the Islamic education sector.</p>

<p>In terms of basic education quality in the Islamic education sub-sector, the challenges are implemented by the limited resourcing, because more than 90% of madrasah are private or community-managed. Data from Mora indicates a high number of under-qualified teachers at 62% for primary and 35% for junior secondary schools.</p>

<p>International comparisons: <a href=""http://en.unesco.org/gem-report/report/2012/youth-and-skills-putting-education-work"" target=""_blank"">The Global Monitoring Report (UNESCO, 2012)</a>, uses the <a href=""http://en.unesco.org/gem-report/education-all-development-index"" target=""_blank"">Education for All Development Index (EDI)</a>, to show that Indonesia reached 0.938. While comparing it to other countries, Indonesia is within the medium range, ranking 64th out of 120 countries. Among neighboring ASEAN countries, Indonesia ranked lower than Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia but higher than the Philippines and Cambodia.</p>

<p><u>Transition Rates</u></p>

<p>There are still large numbers of children who do not continue their studies beyond primary level. Based on 2009/10 school year data, the transition rate from primary to junior secondary schools is 88.2%, which means half a million children did not continue their study to junior secondary level. &nbsp;The transition rate to senior secondary school has tended to fluctuate. It increased from 2004/05 to 2005/6, but decreased in 2006/07; increased again in 2008/09, but then decreased again in 2009/10. While the reason is still unclear, there is a possibility this happened due to the fact that certain provinces failed to submit data in that year.</p>

<p><u>Dropout Rates</u></p>

<p>In 2010/11, reported data shows a relatively low dropout rates at 1.5% for both primary and junior secondary level. According to data from SUSENAS (2011), children who drop out tend to come from families with lower socioeconomic status, 64.4% of children aged 7-12 years and 50% of aged 13-15 years.</p>

<p><u>Geographic Disparities</u></p>

<p>There are 17 provinces (51.5%) with a net enrollment rate for primary school along with 15 provinces (45.5%) are below the average rate for junior secondary school. For primary schools, the gap between the highest rate (Bali) and the lowest rate (Papua Barat) is about 9.1%, while the gap for junior secondary schools is much greater from 93.3% in DKI Jakarta to 62.5% in Papua. Most of the provinces that disparate are located in the Eastern Indonesia. Among the main reasons for these low NER rates may be the unavailability of school facilities and high rates of teacher absenteeism.</p>

<p><u>Teacher Qualification and Distribution</u></p>

<p>Despite the large number of basic education teachers, there are several critical issues that remain: inadequate qualifications of the teachers, uneven distributions of teachers, and inefficient teacher-student ratios. Although in practice the educational qualification does not guarantee better learning, only about 26.8% of primary school teachers have the minimum requirement of a bachelor degree. While in junior secondary schools 76% hold a bachelor degree. Unequal distribution of teachers also leads to a quality gap between urban and rural areas. Teachers tend and prefer to be posted in urban rather than rural areas, which resulting in understaffed schools in remote areas. To address this issue, the central government has decided to distribute teachers across provinces; provincial governments may distribute teachers across districts; and district governments may distribute teachers within their area. In reality, this decision is administratively difficult to implement, as all civil servant teachers are district employees, recruited locally, and receive salaries paid by the district governments. It is also challenging socially and psychologically for the teachers.</p>

<p><u>Applying Standards and Assessing Outcomes</u></p>

<p>There are minimum service standards for basic education in order to ensure a minimum standard of quality across all schools, which requires local governments to provide appropriate number of certified teachers, learning facilities, curriculum, and systematic quality control. &nbsp;Schools are also required to have a minimum number of learning hours and outcome targets, textbooks and reference books for students, learning assessment, school-level curriculum development, and effective school management and community involvement.</p>

<p>It is difficult for the government to identify and address quality-related areas in basic education because of the absence of national map that shows the extent to which these standards are being met at both district and school levels. Other than national examination results, assessment like PIRLS, PISA&nbsp;and TIMSS also need to be used as quality learning outcomes indicators.</p>

<p><u>Bantuan Operasional Sekolah (BOS)</u></p>

<p>Pada tahun 2005, skema BOS diperkenalkan dan memiliki dampak pada tingkat sekolah di seluruh negeri. Pemerintah juga menyediakan dana BOS untuk sekolah SD dan SMP sejak Agustus 2005. Pada tahun 2010/11 dana BOS dapat menutupi sekitar 43 juta siswa di 216.191 sekolah dasar dan juga sekolah menengah pertama dan madrasah negeri dan swasta. Pada tahun 2012, pemerintah mengalokasikan Rp 23 triliun untuk dana BOS, tahun 2013 BOS diberikan ke sekolah-sekolah menengah atas. Hal ini mengakibatkan peningkatan akses yang signifikan pada keluarga tidak mampu. Pada tahun 2009, angka partisipasi kasar (APK) di tingkat sekolah dasar telah meningkat menjadi 93,8%, dan APK pada tingkat sekolah menengah meningkat dari 52% pada tahun 2006 menjadi 59% pada tahun 2009. BOS juga membantu menaikkan tingkat kelulusan dari 50 % hingga 55% pada periode yang sama.</p>

<p>Rencana dana BOS untuk biaya operasional sekolah merupakan inisiatif kebijakan yang paling signifikan, bermanfaat bagi sekolah-sekolah di daerah miskin dan terpencil yang memiliki anggaran operasional yang kurang. Akan tetapi, BOS menurunkan partisipasi masyarakat dalam pendidikan karena orang tua &nbsp;memiliki persepsi bahwa BOS sudah menutupi semua biaya. Orang tua masih diminta untuk memberikan kontribusi keuangan lainnya untuk biaya infrastruktur, peralatan, dan ekstrakurikuler.</p>

<p><u>Sekolah Dasar dan Sekolah Menengah Pertama Satu Atap </u></p>

<p>Komponen utama rencana strategis Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan dan Kementerian Agama adalah untuk menggabungkan sekolah SD dan SMP (satu - atap). Terlepas dari pentingnya strategi untuk meningkatkan akses yang merata, terutama di daerah terpencil, namun tidak ada jaminan adanya pembelajaran berkualitas karena banyak guru di sekolah satu atap adalah guru sekolah dasar. Beberapa guru tersebut hanya mengenyam Pendidikan Guru Sekolah Dasar (PGSD) dua tahun dan bahkan kurang memiliki kompetensi dalam mata pelajaran tertentu di sekolah menengah pertama.</p>

<p><u>Rehabilitasi sekolah</u></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Karena proses perbaikan telah dikelola sendiri oleh sekolah, program ini telah membantu untuk meningkatkan manajemen berbasis sekolah, dengan melibatkan komite sekolah dan orang tua. Dengan demikian, akan ada kontribusi yang signifikan untuk meningkatkan lingkungan belajar. </span></p>

<p>Ada peningkatan tren positif dalam pendidikan dasar di Indonesia, khususnya dalam peningkatan akses pendidikan dasar dan menengah pertama. Sementara itu, kesenjangan masih ada dan masih banyak yang harus dilakukan untuk sepenuhnya mencapai target Renstra dan tujuan EFA pada tahun 2015.</p>

<p><u>Akses dan Pendaftaran</u></p>

<p>Seiring dengan kebijakan wajib belajar sembilan tahun, Indonesia telah hampir mewujudkan akses universal untuk tingkat SD dan kenaikan jumlah pendaftaran untuk tingkat Sekolah Menengah Pertama. Namun demikian, pencapaian ini juga memperlihatkan adanya ketimpangan regional dan sosial-ekonomi.</p>

<p>Tingkat dasar: Sejak tahun 1980 an, angka partisipasi sekolah dasar telah meningkat secara bertahap sebagaiman tercermin dalam angka partisipasi murni (APM) untuk tingkat dasar (95,5% di 2011/12), demikian juga angka partisipasi kasar (APK) (115,4% pada tahun yang sama). Meskipun hal ini menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia berada di jalur untuk mencapai target Renstra dari APM sebesar 96% untuk tingkat SD pada tahun 2014, penyamarataan APM dan APK dilakukan karena kesulitan dalam menyediakan akses bagi semua anak, terutama yang ada di daerah terpencil.</p>

<p>Laporan Monitoring Global UNESCO 2011 menghitung GPI untuk tingkat sekolah dasar di 0,97. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa secara keseluruhan kesempatan untuk mendapatkan dan menyelesaikan pendidikan dasar hampir sama untuk anak laki-laki dan perempuan pada tingkat ini. Namun ketimpangan masih ada di beberapa daerah, terutama di Indonesia Timur.</p>

<p>Tingkat SMP: Pada tahun 1994 pemerintah memprakarsai&nbsp; Program Wajib Belajar Sembilan Tahun yang meningkatkan partisipasi SMP secara signifikan. Antara tahun 2000 - 2009, ada sekitar peningkatan 44% jumlah sekolah menengah pertama. BOS untuk sekolah menengah pertama sejak tahun 2005 dan subsidi bagi siswa miskin juga telah memberikan kontribusi terhadap peningkatan substansial dalam tingkat pendaftaran. Hal ini dapat dilihat dalam peningkatan APM, dari 58,6% menjadi 77,7% (2001 - 2012), hampir mencapai target Renstra sebesar 76,8% pada akhir 2014. APK juga memperlihatkan perbaikan, meningkat dari 76,1% menjadi 99,5% (2001 - 2012).</p>

<p>Sekolah Islam: Karena madrasah sebagian besar melayani masyarakat miskin di pedesaan, madrasah memberikan kontribusi terhadap wajib belajar sembilan tahun di Indonesia. Di tahun 2010/11, ada 22.527 Madrasah Ibtidaiyah (MI) yang melayani 3.082.226 siswa (10,1% dari total pendaftaran untuk tingkat dasar) di seluruh negeri. Seiring dengan 14.022 Madrasah Tsanawiyah (MT) - setara dengan tingkat SMP -, melayani 2.587.106 siswa. Pondok Pesantren adalah paket kesetaraan SD dan SMP yang diperkenalkan oleh sektor pendidikan Islam.</p>

<p>Dalam hal kualitas pendidikan dasar di sub-sektor pendidikan Islam, permasalahan yang dihadapi adalah terbatasnya sumber daya, karena lebih dari 90% dari madrasah dikelola swasta atau masyarakat. Data dari Kemenag menunjukkan tingginya jumlah guru yang kurang berkualitas yaitu 62% untuk tingkat dasar dan 35% untuk sekolah menengah pertama.</p>

<p>Perbandingan internasional: Laporan Monitoring Global (UNESCO, 2012), menggunakan Indeks Pembangunan Pendidikan untuk Semua (EDI), untuk menunjukkan pencapaian Indonesia sebesar 0,938. Bila dibandingkan dengan negara-negara lain, Indonesia berada di peringkat menengah, peringkat ke-64 dari 120 negara. Di antara negara-negara tetangga ASEAN, peringkat Indonesia lebih rendah dari Brunei Darussalam dan Malaysia tetapi lebih tinggi dari Filipina dan Kamboja.</p>

<p><u>Tingkat transisi</u></p>

<p>Masih banyak anak-anak yang tidak melanjutkan studi mereka selepas tingkat dasar. Berdasarkan Data tahun ajaran 2009/10, tingkat transisi dari SD ke SMP adalah 88,2%, yang berarti setengah juta anak-anak tidak melanjutkan ke tingkat SMP. Tingkat transisi ke sekolah menengah atas cenderung turun anik. Angkanya meningkat dari tahun 2004/05 ke 2005/6, tetapi menurun pada tahun 2006/07; meningkat lagi pada 2008/09, tapi kemudian menurun lagi pada 2009/10. Sementara alasannya masih belum jelas, ada kemungkinan ini terjadi provinsi tertentu tidak mengirimkan data pada tahun yang bersangkutan.</p>

<p><u>tingkat putus sekolah</u></p>

<p>Di tahun 2010/11, data menunjukkan tingkat putus sekolah relatif rendah sebesar 1,5% pad tingkat SD dan SMP. Menurut data dari SUSENAS (2011), anak-anak yang putus sekolah cenderung berasal dari keluarga dengan status sosial ekonomi rendah, sebesar 64,4% anak usia 7-12 tahun dan 50% dari usia 13-15 tahun.</p>

<p><u>Perbedaan geografis </u></p>

<p>Ada 17 provinsi (51,5%) dengan tingkat partisipasi murni sekolah dasar bersama dengan 15 provinsi (45,5%) berada di bawah rata-rata untuk sekolah menengah pertama. Untuk sekolah dasar, kesenjangan antara tingkat tertinggi (Bali) dan tingkat terendah (Papua Barat) adalah sekitar 9,1%, sedangkan kesenjangan bagi sekolah menengah pertama jauh lebih besar yaitu sebesar 93,3% di DKI Jakarta dan sebesar 62,5% di Papua. Sebagian besar provinsi yang berbeda terletak di Timur Indonesia. Penyebab utamanya angka APM yang &nbsp;rendah adalah tidak tersedianya fasilitas sekolah dan masih tingginya tingkat ketidakhadiran guru.</p>

<p><u>Kualifikasi dan Penyebaran Guru</u></p>

<p>Meskipun jumlah guru pendidikan dasar banyak, ada beberapa masalah penting yang muncul: kualifikasi guru kurang, penyebaran guru tidak merata, dan rasio guru-murid tidak efisien. Meskipun dalam prakteknya kualifikasi pendidikan tidak menjamin pembelajaran yang lebih baik, hanya sekitar 26,8% dari guru sekolah dasar memiliki persyaratan minimal gelar sarjana. Sementara di SMP 76% memegang gelar sarjana. Penyebaran guru yang tidak merata juga menyebabkan kesenjangan kualitas antara daerah perkotaan dan pedesaan. Guru cenderung dan lebih memilih untuk ditempatkan di perkotaan daripada pedesaan, sehingga sekolah-sekolah di daerah terpencil memiliki kekurangan tenaga guru. Untuk mengatasi masalah ini, pemerintah pusat memutuskan untuk mendistribusikan guru di seluruh provinsi; pemerintah provinsi dapat mendistribusikan guru ke seluruh kabupaten; dan pemerintah kabupaten dapat mendistribusikan guru di daerah mereka. Pada kenyataannya, keputusan ini secara administratif sulit untuk dilaksanakan, karena semua guru PNS adalah pegawai kabupaten, direkrut secara lokal, dan menerima gaji yang dibayarkan oleh pemerintah kabupaten. Secara sosial dan psikologis hal ini juga menjadi permasalahan bagi guru.</p>

<p><u>Menerapkan Standar dan Menilai Hasil</u></p>

<p>Ada standar pelayanan minimum untuk pendidikan dasar untuk memastikan standar minimum kualitas di semua sekolah, sehingga pemerintah daerah harus menyediakan sejumlah guru tersertifikasi, fasilitas belajar, kurikulum, dan kendali mutu yang sistematis. Sekolah juga diminta untuk memiliki jumlah minimum jam dan target hasil, buku pelajaran dan buku referensi belajar bagi siswa, penilaian belajar, pengembangan kurikulum tingkat sekolah, dan manajemen sekolah yang efektif serta keterlibatan masyarakat.</p>

<p>Pemerintah mengalami kesulitan mengidentifikasi dan mengatasi permasalahan kualitas pendidikan dasar karena tidak adanya peta nasional yang menunjukkan sejauh mana standar ini terpenuhi di tingkat kabupaten dan tingkat sekolah. Selain hasil ujian nasional, penilaian seperti PIRLS, PISA, dan TIMSS juga dapt digunakan sebagai indikator hasil pembelajaran yang berkualitas.</p>

Non-formal SSE consists of senior secondary Package C (Paket C), which is equivalent to SMA.

<p>SSE has expanded through private senior secondary schools that continued to dominate the sub-sector in terms of numbers of schools. For approximately 70% of senior secondary schools, privately run schools tend to have much lower enrollments than public schools.</p>

<p><u>Increased Access to SSE</u></p>

<p>Between 2000/2001 and 2011/12, the number of private and public senior secondary schools throughout Indonesia doubled from 12,415 to 26,896. Over the same period, total enrollments increased by 82% and the number of SSE teachers nearly doubled (from 342,443 to 571,591). during the same period, There have also been steady improvements in both net enrollment (NER) and gross enrollment rates (GER).&nbsp;GER has increased from 42.8% in 2000/2001 to 76.4% in 2011/12, and NER has increased from 35.0% to 57.7%. The current GER of 76.4% makes the government aims for universal access to SSE by 2015.</p>

<p>Despite this expansion, the average level of educational attainment is still relatively low. The average number of years of education of an Indonesian citizen aged 19 years (the age when a person should complete senior secondary school) and older was only 7.98 in 2010, which is the equivalent of reaching the second year of junior secondary school. Ongoing efforts to increase access to SSE will contribute to increasing the average number of years of education and will better position the country to derive maximum benefit from the &lsquo;demographic dividend&rsquo;.</p>

<p><u>Public vs. Private Senior Secondary Education</u></p>

<p>Public school system appears to be more efficient than the private school system. The student to school ratio (SSR)&nbsp;in the private system is 235 students per school, while at the public system is around 513 studentsper school. In terms of student to teacher ratio (STR), the public system appears to be more efficient than the private system, 14 for SMA and 13 for SMK, while the private system has an STR of only 10 and 9 for SMA and SMK, respectively (2009/10).</p>

<p><u>Geographic Inequalities</u></p>

<p>A comparison of GER across 460 districts shows considerable variation, from as low as 22.4% to 134.3%. The 15 provinces that have a GER below that of the national level are distributed almost evenly between Java and the western regions on one hand, and the eastern regions on the other. This suggests that the regional &lsquo;divide&rsquo; (i.e. between Eastern Indonesia and the rest of the country), which is usually assumed, may not be applicable in the case of SSE enrollments.</p>

<p><u>Gender Inequality</u></p>

<p>The gender parity index (GPI) of SSE shows that females at general senior secondary school or SMA level increased from 1.07 to 1.14 between 2000 and 2010. However, overall figures include the GPI for vocational schools or SMK, where the ratio of females to males has actually declined over the past decade (from 0.76 to 0.71). This may be related to the fact that many of the courses offered in SMK are regarded to relate to male-dominated occupations and that SMA courses are seen as more appropriate for females.</p>

<p><u>Efficiency of Senior Secondary Education</u></p>

<p>Senior secondary education faces problems in inefficiency in respect to dropout and repetition rates, and to a low student/teacher ratio. This represents a significant waste of educational resource, where in 2010/11, 142,275 students dropped out from SMA, while 98,640 dropped out from SMK. Furthermore, a total of 27,215 students across both types of school repeated classes. From the viewpoint of student/teacher ratio, the efficiency level of senior secondary education provision is relatively low. Furthermore, efficiency declined during the last decade. Some of the factors are the fact that the smaller size and enrollments of private SSE schools will result in a lower student/ teacher ratio. In addition, the lower student/teacher ratio for SMK may be associated with the larger number of courses and programs of study offered. Overall, while SMK offers up to 96 different study programs, SMA offers only three study programs (Natural Science, Social Science, and Language).</p>

<p><u>Peningkatan Akses ke Sekolah Menengah Atas</u></p>

<p>Antara 2000/2001 dan 2011/12, jumlah sekolah menengah atas swasta dan negeri di seluruh Indonesia dua kali lipat dari 12.415 menjadi 26.896. Selama periode yang sama, total pendaftaran meningkat 82% dan jumlah guru SMA hampir dua kali lipat (dari 342.443 menjadi 571.591). Selama periode yang sama, terlihat adanya peningkatan stabil baik angka partisipasi murni maupun angka partisipasi kasar. APK telah meningkat dari 42,8% di tahun 2000/2001 menjadi 76,4% pada tahun 2011/12, dan APM meningkat dari 35,0% menjadi 57,7%. APK saat ini 76,4% mendorong pemerintah untuk mencapai akses universal SMA pada tahun 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meskipun adanya penambahan, tingkat rata-rata pencapaian pendidikan masih relatif rendah. Rata-rata jumlah tahun pendidikan dari warga negara Indonesia berusia 19 tahun (usia ketika seseorang harus menyelesaikan sekolah menengah atas) dan di sebelumnya hanya 7,98 pada tahun 2010, yang setara dengan menyelesaikan tahun kedua sekolah menengah pertama. Upaya-upaya untuk meningkatkan akses ke SMA memberikan kontribusi pada peningkatan rata-rata jumlah tahun pendidikan dan menempatkan posisi negara lebih baik sehingga dapat &nbsp;memperoleh manfaat maksimal dari &#39;bonus demografi&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Pendidikan Menengah Negeri vs Swasta</u></p>

<p>Sistem sekolah negeri tampaknya lebih efisien daripada sistem sekolah swasta. Rasio siswa sekolah &nbsp;dalam sekolah swasta &nbsp;adalah 235 siswa per sekolah, sedangkan rasio siswa guru dalam sekolah negeri sekitar 513. Untuk rasio siswa guru, sistem negeri juga tampaknya lebih efisien daripada sistem swasta, 14 untuk SMA dan 13 untuk SMK, sedangkan sistem swasta memiliki rasio siswa guru hanya masing-masing 10 untuk SMA dan 9 &nbsp;untuk &nbsp;SMK (2009/10).</p>

<p><u>Perbedaan geografis </u></p>

<p>Perbandingan APK di 460 kabupaten menunjukkan adanya perbedaan, dari terendah 22,4% menjadi 134,3%. Sekitar 15 provinsi dengan APK di bawah tingkat nasional merata antara Jawa dan wilayah barat di satu sisi, dan wilayah timur di sisi lain. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa kesenjangan daerah ( yakni antara Indonesia Timur dan wilayah lainnya), yang biasanya ada, mungkin tidak ditemukan dalam pendaftaran pendidikan menengah atas ini.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Ketimpangan Gender</u></p>

<p>Indeks &nbsp;kesetaraan gender (IKG) dari SMA menunjukkan bahwa perempuan di sekolah menengah atas umum atau tingkat SMA meningkat dari 1,07 menjadi 1,14 antara tahun 2000 dan 2010. Namun, angka ini adalah angka keseluruhan termasuk IKG untuk sekolah kejuruan atau SMK, di mana rasio perempuan dengan laki-laki menurun selama dekade terakhir (dari 0,76 menjadi 0,71). Hal ini mungkin disebabkan &nbsp;karena banyak program studi yang ditawarkan di SMK dianggap berhubungan dengan pekerjaan yang didominasi laki-laki dan pendidikan SMA &nbsp;dipandang lebih sesuai untuk perempuan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Efisiensi Pendidikan Menengah Atas</u></p>

<p>Pendidikan menengah atas menghadapi masalah inefisiensi yang berhubungan dengan tingkat putus sekolah dan pengulangan, dan rasio siswa / guru yang rendah. Hal ini menunjukan adanya pemborosan sumber daya pendidikan, di mana di 2010/11, 142.275 siswa putus dari SMA, sementara 98.640 putus dari SMK. Selain itu, total 27.215 siswa di kedua jenis sekolah mengulang kelas. Dari sudut pandang rasio siswa / guru, tingkat efisiensi penyediaan pendidikan menengah atas relatif rendah. Selain itu, efisiensi menurun selama dekade terakhir. Beberapa faktor penyebabnya adalah fakta bahwa ukuran dan pendaftaran yang lebih kecil di sekolah SMA swasta mengakibatkan rasio siswa / guru yang lebih rendah. Selain itu, rasio siswa / guru yang lebih rendah untuk SMK berhubungan dengan banyaknya jumlah dan program studi yang ditawarkan. Secara keseluruhan, SMK menawarkan hingga 96 program studi yang berbeda, sedangkan SMA hanya menawarkan tiga program studi (Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam, Ilmu Sosial, dan Bahasa).</p>

It is offered through SMKs at the formal secondary level, Diploma I, II&nbsp;and III at polytechnics and/or academies at higher education level.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Enrollment in vocational education has seen a significant increase of 158% between 2001 and 2010. This rapid growth is in large part a reflection of the priority of the government, which has made this sub-sector a key strategy for economic development.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Vocational education at the senior secondary and tertiary levels is mandated under all education-related laws, including <a href=""http://kelembagaan.ristekdikti.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/UU_no_20_th_2003.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Education Law 20/2003</a>. Standards for vocational education are determined by <a href=""http://bsnp-indonesia.org/?page_id=61"" target=""_blank"">National Standards of Education (SNP)</a>, operated under the National Education Standards Board (BSNP). Institutional accreditation has been conducted by the <a href=""http://bansm.or.id/"" target=""_blank"">National Accreditation Board for Schools and Madrasahs (BAN SM)</a>, the <a href=""https://banpt.or.id/"" target=""_blank"">National Accreditation Board for Higher Education (BAN PT)</a>, and the <a href=""http://web.banpnf.or.id/"" target=""_blank"">National Accreditation Board for Non-Formal Education (BAN PNF)</a>. Teacher certification falls under the supervision of the Board of Education Human Resource Development and Quality Assurance.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The main responsibility for overseeing formal vocational education at the senior secondary education (SSE) level sits with the Directorate General (DG) of SSE. The responsibility for vocational education at the tertiary level sits with the DG of Higher Education. Non-formal vocational training is the responsibility of the DG of Early Childhood Education, Non- Formal Education&nbsp;and Informal Education, which are within the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC). Operational activities related to formal vocational education at the SSE level and non-formal vocational training both fall under the responsibility of district or municipality governments.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">BSNP&nbsp;has issued detailed competency standards and curriculum guidelines for the provision of vocational education. In addition, the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration has issued <a href=""http://bnsp.go.id/sertifikasi/skkni/standar_kompetensi_kerja_nasional_indonesia.html"" target=""_blank"">National Competency Standards for Works</a>, which were developed in cooperation with industry stakeholders. Currently, the government is identifying feasible ways to include industry-relevant competency standards into the curricula of vocational schools. However, neither industry nor the ministries involved have reached an agreement on how these standards could be implemented at vocational school level or in terms of curriculum components, performance assessment and certification.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Under the Ministry of Education decree 036/O/1997, the SMK could provide training in mechanical engineering (previously provided through technical high schools or STM), pastry making (previously provided through tourism secondary school or SMIP)&nbsp;and wood-craft (previously served through handicraft industry high school or SMIK). Thus, a district may have one SMK providing&nbsp;three types of skills, rather than three different schools (STM, SMIP&nbsp;and SMIK), each providing&nbsp;only one type of skill. This potentially improves efficiency in vocational education service delivery. The reforms also made major changes to curricula in order to ensure that student training responded to local labor market needs. A so-called &lsquo;broad-based&rsquo; curriculum was adopted, where students study more general subjects in their first year, since many of them still could not decide their specialization, and then focus more on specialized areas as they move to higher grades.</p>

<p>Quality of Graduates and Opportunity to Meet Market Demand</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>To a considerable extent, this expansion of vocational schooling has been &lsquo;supply&rsquo; driven rather than a product of preferences expressed by the private sector, notwithstanding the innovative activities of selected SMKs in building close links with business.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Due to lack of facilities/equipment, students in private vocational schools seem to have lower scores compared to public SMKs. Public vocational students have an average math score of 5.4, while private SMK students have a lower mathematics score with an average of 5.1. There is a clear need to strengthen student performance in vocational schools, especially private vocational schools.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The availability of jobs has been big a problem for SMK graduates, as it has for other young people. There is little evidence that graduates from SMK have significantly different labor market outcomes than graduates from SMA. Graduates from SMA and SMK have similar unemployment rates upon graduation. National data show that unemployment was highest for young SMA and SMK graduates among schooling groups, reaching a disturbing level of nearly 40% in 2012. The rates for females, however, were lower in SMK compared with SMA graduates.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Demand for SMA graduates is likely to grow more quickly over the next five years than for SMK graduates.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Employer Skills Surveys show that a significant share of senior secondary graduates does not meet employer expectations, and there are no differences between SMA and SMK graduates. Employees from the vocational education stream have a higher percentage of &ldquo;very good&rdquo; scores and lower percentages of &ldquo;poor&rdquo; scores from employers. However, the overall quality of employees with senior secondary education is an issue for both streams.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Graduates from both SMA and SMK might suffer for different reasons. While SMK provides a quick means of training mid-level skilled workers to respond to the immediate needs of the labor market, it may not provide students with the general skills that will make them employable in the future. They also may not be able to gain access to tertiary education as even the entrance exams of polytechnics tend to focus heavily on academic skills and, consequently, have favored SMA graduates rather than SMK graduates. In turn, SMA graduates who do not enter tertiary education may lack sufficient job-relevant skills.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>When expanding senior secondary education, the ratio of SMA to SMK expansion that is supply driven might inefficiently allocate students across tracks. For example, the ability of students with the potential to continue to post-secondary studies might be limited if they were streamed into SMK. In turn, providing general education to students not interested in continuing studies might be a less effective option than providing them locally relevant vocational education.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Graduates&rsquo; Professional Earnings</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>There are also no significant differences between the earnings of graduates fresh from SMA or SMK, although earnings of SMK graduates depreciate much faster after 7-8 years, even though they tended to be higher among female SMK graduates who mostly studied in less technically oriented programs.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=8"" target=""_blank"">SMK Financing and Education Cost</a></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The cost of providing and attending SMK is higher than providing and attending SMA. Thus, a proactive expansion of SMK enrolment, at a greater ratio than SMA enrolment, will have big implications on the cost of expanding senior secondary education. The increased cost might only be justified if there are clear differences in the education and labor market outcomes of students in both tracks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Household expenditure for attending both public and private SMK is higher than attending SMA. The cost of attendance is highest for private SMK, and households spend around IDR 2.7 million a year. Students in public SMA spend almost half that at IDR 1.7 million a year. Private SMK are significantly more expensive than public SMA for all income quintiles. Expanding through private provision might be more efficient, if price differences are not a reflection of quality. However, if the private schools, which are catering to poor students, are of significantly lower quality, expanding access through private providers would be problematic in the absence of strong quality assurance mechanisms for these schools.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Public SMK have better facilities than private SMKs for all types of facilities.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Availability and Quality of SMK <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=7"" target=""_blank"">Teachers</a></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Various studies have identified the most important issues associated with the expansion of SMKs are associated with the training, skills and deployment of teachers, while other problems include equipment and facilities, curriculum, links with private enterprise and certification of graduates.</p>

	<li>Teachers are typically divided into three groups: normative or teachers of general subjects such as language, religion and civics; adaptive or academic teachers (teachers of math, science and related subjects); and productive or vocational teachers (henceforth referred to as vocational teachers). With regards to vocational teachers, shortages were reported by school principals as the main problem faced by SMK in over 60% of cases (Provincial Education Office, PEO, survey of SMK in 2013). There seems to be a shortage in SMK teachers, especially in private SMK, as the student teacher ratio is high. However, SMKs may have excluded other members of the teaching force like the laboratory specialist, mechanics and installation supervisors, and this should be considered. On average, public SMK have 60-80 teachers, while private SMK are much smaller and have an average of about 40 teachers. Student teacher ratios in public SMK is 1:40, while in private SMK it is 1:37.</li>

","Pendidikan Pengembangan Keterampilan","<p>Pendidikan dan pelatihan kejuruan diselenggarakan melalui layanan formal dan non-formal. Pendidikan kejuruan formal lebih besar dari dua sub-sektor lain dan diberikan pada tingkat menengah melalui sekolah-sekolah kejuruan menengah atas (SMK) dan tingkat pendidikan tinggi melalui Diploma I, II, III, dan IV termasuk program 3-tahun di politeknik dan akadem.</p>

<p>Pendaftaran di pendidikan kejuruan mengalami peningkatan signifikan dari 158% antara tahun 2001 dan 2010. Pertumbuhan yang cepat ini sebagian besar merupakan refleksi dari prioritas pemerintah, yang telah membuat sub-sektor in menjadi strategi utama dalam pembangunan ekonomi.</p>

<p>Pendidikan kejuruan di tingkat menengah dan tinggi diamanatkan dalam semua undang-undang yang berhubungan dengan pendidikan, termasuk UU Pendidikan 20/2003. Standar pendidikan kejuruan ditentukan oleh Standar Nasional Pendidikan (SNP), yang dilaksanakan di bawah Badan Standar Nasional Pendidikan (BSNP). akreditasi kelembagaan telah dilakukan oleh Badan Akreditasi Nasional Sekolah dan Madrasah (BAN SM), Badan Nasional Akreditasi Perguruan Tinggi (BAN PT), dan Badan Akreditasi Nasional Pendidikan Non-Formal (BAN PNF). Sertifikasi guru berada di bawah pengawasan Badan Pendidikan Pengembangan Sumber Daya Manusia dan Jaminan Mutu.</p>

<p>Direktorat Jenderal (Ditjen) Pendidikan Menengah Atas memiliki tanggung jawab utama untuk mengawasi pendidikan kejuruan formal di tingkat pendidikan menengah atas. Tanggung jawab untuk pendidikan kejuruan di tingkat pendidikan tinggi berada dibawah Ditjen Pendidikan Tinggi. Pelatihan kejuruan non-formal merupakan tanggung jawab Ditjen Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini, Pendidikan Non-formal, dan Pendidikan Informal, yang berada di Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan. Kegiatan operasional yang berkaitan dengan pendidikan kejuruan formal di tingkat SMA dan pelatihan kejuruan non formal keduanya berada di bawah tanggung jawab pemerintah kabupaten atau kotamadya.</p>

<p>Badan Nasional Standar Pendidikan (BSNP) telah mengeluarkan standar kompetensi dan pedoman kurikulum yang rinci untuk penyelenggaraan pendidikan kejuruan. Selain itu, Kementerian Tenaga Kerja dan Transmigrasi telah menerbitkan Standar Kompetensi Kerja Nasional, yang dikembangkan dengan para pemangku kepentingan industri. Saat ini, pemerintah sedang mengidentifikasi cara-cara yang tepat untuk memasukan standar kompetensi industri yang relevan ke dalam kurikulum sekolah kejuruan. Namun, baik industri maupun kementerian terkait tidak mencapai kesepakatan tentang bagaimana standar tersebut dapat dilaksanakan di tingkat sekolah kejuruan atau dalam hal komponen kurikulum, penilaian kinerja dan sertifikasi.</p>

<p>Sistem baru yang dikenalkan dalam Keputusan Menteri Pendidikan no. 36 / O / 1997 hanya memiliki satu jenis sekolah menengah kejuruan (SMK) dari enam jenis yang sebelumnya ada. Dalam sistem ini, sebuah SMK dapat memberikan berbagai mata pelajaran kejuruan dan tidak mengkhususkan diri hanya dalam bidang terbatas. Reformasi juga membuat perubahan besar dalam kurikulum guna memastikan bahwa pelatihan siswa merespon kebutuhan pasar tenaga kerja lokal. Kurikulum yang disebut &#39;broad based diadopsi untuk siswa yang belum siap untuk memilih bidang spesialisasi sehingga mereka akan mempelajari mata pelajaran yang lebih umum di tahun pertama dan kemudian lebih fokus pada bidang-bidang khusus ketika naik ke kelas yang lebih tinggi.</p>

<p>Kualitas Lulusan dan Peluang untuk memenuhi permintaan pasar</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ekspansi sekolah kejuruan telah menjadi &#39; supply &#39; driven dan bukan hasil preferensi yang disampaikan oleh sektor swasta, meskipun kegiatan inovatif yang dipilih SMK sangat berhubungan dengan bisnis.</li>
	<li>Karena kurangnya fasilitas / peralatan, siswa di sekolah kejuruan swasta memiliki nilai lebih rendah dibandingkan dengan SMK negeri. Siswa SMK negeri memiliki skor matematika rata-rata 5,4, sedangkan siswa SMK swasta memiliki skor matematika yang lebih rendah dengan rata-rata 5,1. Ada kebutuhan yang jelas untuk memperkuat kinerja siswa di sekolah-sekolah kejuruan, terutama swasta.</li>
	<li>Ketersediaan pekerjaan menjadi masalah bagi lulusan SMK, sebagaimana dihadapi oleh anank-anak muda lainnya. Ada sedikit bukti bahwa lulusan SMK memiliki pasar tenaga kerja lebih besar dibanding dari lulusan SMA. Lulusan SMA dan SMK memiliki tingkat pengangguran yang sama setelah lulus. Data nasional menunjukkan bahwa pengangguran lebih tinggi di SMA daripada SMK, mencapai tingkat mengkhawatirkan hampir 40% pada tahun 2012. Akan tetapi Perempuan lebih rendah di SMK dibandingkan dengan SMA</li>
	<li>Permintaan untuk lulusan SMA cenderung tumbuh lebih cepat selama lima tahun ke depan daripada untuk lulusan SMK graduates</li>
	<li>Survei Keterampilan para pengusaha menunjukkan bahwa banyak lulusan SMA yang tidak memenuhi harapan pengusaha, dan tidak ada perbedaan antara lulusan SMA dan SMK. Karyawan dari pendidikan kejuruan memiliki persentase nilai &ldquo; sangat baik &rdquo; yang lebih tinggi dan persentase nilai &nbsp;&ldquo;kurang&rdquo; lebih rendah. Namun demikian, kualitas keseluruhan karyawan dari kedua pendidikan menengah atas ini masih rendah.</li>
	<li>Lulusan dari SMA dan SMK mungkin memiliki alasan yang berbeda. SMK menyediakan cara cepat melatih pekerja terampil tingkat menengah untuk menanggapi kebutuhan mendesak pasar tenaga kerja, tapi tidak memberikan rampilan umum yang akan membuat mereka dipekerjakan di masa depan. Mereka juga mungkin tidak memperoleh akses ke pendidikan tinggi karena ujian masuk politeknik cenderung lebih mengutamakan keterampilan akademik dan, akibatnya, PT lebih &nbsp;disukai lulusan SMA daripada lulusan SMK. Sebaliknya, lulusan SMA yang tidak masuk pendidikan tinggi tidak memiliki keterampilan kerja relevan yang memadai.</li>
	<li>Ketika memperluas pendidikan menengah atas, rasio SMA terhadap SMK yang lebih ditentukan oleh supply mungkin tidak mengalokasikan siswa di seluruh bagian secara&nbsp; efisien. Misalnya, kemampuan siswa yang berpotensi untuk melanjutkan sekolah terbatas jika mereka sekolah di SMK. Sebaliknya, memberikan pendidikan umum untuk siswa yang tidak tertarik untuk melanjutkan studi mungkin menjadi pilihan yang kurang efektif dibanding&nbsp; memberikan mereka pendidikan kejuruan yang relevan secara lokal.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pendapatan Lulusan Profesi</p>

<ol>
	<li>Juga tidak ada perbedaan yang signifikan antara pendapatan lulusan baru SMA atau SMK, meskipun pendapatan lulusan SMK terdepresiasi lebih cepat setelah 7-8 tahun, walaupun lebih tinggi di antara lulusan SMK perempuan yang sebagian besar belajar pada program orientasi non teknik.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pembiayaan SMK dan Biaya Pendidikan</p>

<ol>
	<li>Biaya penyelenggaraan dan sekolah di SMK lebih tinggi daripada penyelenggaraan dan sekolah di&nbsp; SMA. Dengan demikian, ekspansi proaktif pendaftaran SMK, dengan rasio yang lebih besar dari pendaftaran SMA, memiliki implikasi besar pada biaya perluasan pendidikan menengah atas. Biaya meningkat mungkin dapat dimaklumi bila ada perbedaan yang jelas dalam hasil pendidikan dan pasar tenaga kerja siswa di kedua tracks.</li>
	<li>pengeluaran keluarga untuk sekolah di SMK baik negeri maupun swasta lebih tinggi dari pada sekolah di SMA. Biaya sekolah tertinggi untuk SMK swasta, dan keluarga menghabiskan sekitar Rp 2,7 juta setahun. Siswa di SMA negeri menghabiskan hampir setengahnya yaitu sebesar Rp 1,7 juta per tahun. SMK Swasta secara signifikan lebih mahal daripada SMA umum untuk semua kuintil pendapatan. Memperluas penyelenggaraan melalui jalur swasta bisa lebih efisien, jika harga tidak menunjukan kualitas. Namun, jika sekolah swasta, yang menampung siswa miskin, memiliki kualitas lebih rendah, memperluas akses melalui penyedia swasta akan bermasalah karena tidak adanya mekanisme jaminan kualitas yang kuat untuk sekolah-sekolah ini.</li>
	<li>SMK negeri memiliki fasilitas yang lebih baik dari SMK swasta untuk semua jenis fasilitas.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Ketersediaan dan Kualitas Guru SMK</p>

<ol>
	<li>Berbagai penelitian mengidentifikasi masalah paling penting yang terkait dengan perluasan SMK yaitu pelatihan, keterampilan dan penyebaran guru, sedangkan masalah lain termasuk peralatan, &nbsp;fasilitas, kurikulum, hubungan dengan perusahaan swasta serta sertifikasi lulusan.</li>
	<li>Guru biasanya dibagi menjadi tiga kelompok: normatif atau guru mata pelajaran umum seperti bahasa, agama dan kewarganegaraan; guru adaptif atau akademik (guru matematika, sains dan mata kuliah terkait); dan guru produktif atau kejuruan (selanjutnya disebut sebagai guru kejuruan). Guru kejuruan ditemukan adanya &nbsp;kekurangan sebagai masalah utama yang dihadapi SMK di lebih dari 60% kasus (Dinas Pendidikan Provinsi, PEO, survei SMK tahun 2013)</li>
	<li>Ada kekurangan pada guru SMK , terutama di SMK swasta, dimana rasio siswa guru tinggi. Namun, SMK tidak memasukan anggota lain seperti ahli laboratorium, mekanik dan pengawas instalasi, dan ini harus dipertimbangkan. Rata-rata, SMK negeri memiliki 60-80 guru, sedangkan SMK swasta jauh lebih sedikit dan memiliki rata-rata sekitar 40 guru. Rasio siswa-guru di SMK negeri adalah 01:40, sedangkan di SMK swasta 01:37.</li>

It is a strategy for improving quality. The ISS law has been in debate and is currently under review by the Constitutional Court.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">ISS qualification requires a school to meet the eight <a href=""http://bsnp-indonesia.org/?page_id=61"" target=""_blank"">National Education Standards (NES)</a>. The ISS general characteristics or requirements that are identified by <a href=""https://mudarwan.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/permendiknas_nomor_78_tahun_2009_tentang_penyelenggaraan_sbi.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Ministerial Regulation 78/2009</a> are: (i) using English as the medium of instruction in science, mathematics, and vocational subjects; (ii) adopting curricula and an accreditation standard from an OECD or other developed country; (iii) being accredited by a school in an <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/"" target=""_blank"">OECD</a> or other developed country; engaging and collaborating with an overseas &ldquo;sister school&rdquo;; (iv) <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=7"" target=""_blank"">requiring teachers and principals to have S2 (masters) degrees</a>; (v) having fully equipped <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=31"" target=""_blank"">ICT</a> facilities; etc.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">There are numbers of stakeholders&rsquo; perceptions and understanding in response to the government&rsquo;s purpose in requiring ISS to be formed in every district and city. The purposes are to give parents an easy access to prepare their children to study in foreign universities after high school, to prepare students in getting employed overseas, as well as to improve the overall quality of schools in Indonesia.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">MoEC has&nbsp;selected and approved schools as candidates to become fully compliant ISS called International School Stubs&nbsp;or RSBI. Schools with RSBI receive additional funds to support their efforts towards ISS and an exemption from the &ldquo;free education&rdquo; policy (Ministerial decree 29/2007), which allows RSBI schools to collect funds from parents (tuition) to support international standard programs and resource needs. There are different management and organizational practices at the provincial and district government levels, which can be grouped into two:</p>

<ol>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Organizational structures that have dedicated units and staff for managing and administering RSBI</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Organizational structures that assign RSBI responsibilities to existing units and staff as additional responsibilities.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Schools selected to develop ISS schools are those among the best existing schools.</p>

	<ul>
		<li dir=""ltr"">
		<p dir=""ltr"">Most of the schools are located in more affluent area in district or city, and so the parents are willing to pay for extra fees</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Provinces and city/districts monitor the use of funds received by RSBI. Provincial governments monitor the use of funds they distribute to schools from their own annual budgets (APBD/Province) as well as monitor block grants for RSBI received from MoEC--not all provinces receive blocks grants in a given year City/ district governments monitor funds allocated to RSBI schools from their own annual budgets (APBD/City/District) and also monitor the use of funds that the schools receive directly from MoEC.</p>

<div class=""collapsible-item-body panel-body"">
<p>Some issues&nbsp;include the fact that RSBI special training on management, administration&nbsp;and monitoring and evaluation have not been received by the provincial and city/district staff who handle RSBI responsibilities. The ISS program debate is also focused on the issues of equity, access&nbsp;and school capacity, as well as whether the policy is based on the basic principles of quality and equitable access that guide education in Indonesia. The current RSBI program is also seen as not affordable; the unit cost per student is about four times that of regular school funding. RSBI program is not cost effective and none of the RSBIs have achieved ISS status. Very few, in fact, are meeting standards. Requirement to teach English becomes a barrier for teachers and students to understand the material</p>

<p>However, the ISS program policy and implementation environment aims to raise the education standard in a select set of schools by applying specific quality improvement measures and providing line-item resources. By carefully evaluating the ISS program, policy makers and education stakeholders are able to determine what is needed for sustained quality improvement in the Indonesian education development context, what quality improvement measures work in the Indonesian context, and what are the costs of quality improvement in terms of financial and human resources.</p>

<p><u>Policy Option 1 - Maintain Current ISS Policy</u></p>

<p>There are great investments in the RSBI program to build infrastructure, procure equipment and train teachers with significant government funding (over Rp.1 trillion), as well as the amounts from fees paid by parents and contributions from the business community. Students, school personnel, parents and communities expect international schools to be&nbsp;made available in every district and city in the country. The expense and the perception that the program is a government subsidized program for the &ldquo;elite.&rdquo; are the concerns of a number of influential stakeholders.</p>

<p>This policy option concludes that raising standards of select schools to meet international standards has not been effective in improving students&rsquo; performance on the Indonesian national exams (Ujian Nasional).&nbsp;It is difficult, expensive and time consuming to meet all the standards and requirements for RSBI.</p>

<p><u>Policy Option 2 - Terminate RSBI Program</u></p>

<p>The high cost of the program absorbs government funds that could be used for more crucial needs such as assisting schools and districts to meet <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=43"" target=""_blank"">minimum service standards (MSS)</a> and implement free basic education in accordance with current policy. The vast amount of investment has not shown improvement in student performance such as the National Test (Ujian Nasional or UN) of RSBI students are on average similar to those who have not received RSBI investments. Also that the expensive equipment procured are not being used effectively.</p>

<p>The RSBI program has also been criticized that it discriminates against disadvantaged children and children from lower socioeconomic strata. Children from lower socioeconomic groups tend to have lower academic performance than those who are from higher socioeconomic groups. &nbsp;Many times, the more affluent students mock the disadvantaged students who receive subsidies and special treatment.</p>

<p>The evidence demonstrates that there is high motivation for teachers to improve instruction, learn English and work toward advanced degrees. Other schools have been motivated to improve their quality of instruction with the hopes that these schools may someday enter the RSBI program.</p>

<p>Termination of the program could have a negative impact in community coherence and education quality improvement motivation in the future. It will also be a waste in investments already made if the policy is terminated.</p>

<p><u>Policy Option 3 - Modify Current Policies and Regulations</u></p>

<p>The evaluation results and the ISS current research identify that shortcomings can be resolved by making modifications in the regulations underlying but not changing <a href=""http://kelembagaan.ristekdikti.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/UU_no_20_th_2003.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Law 20/2003</a>. The advantages of this option are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Sustain and make further use of the investments already made through the RSBI program,</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Not result in disappointment and reduced motivation that termination might cause at the grassroots and continue to be a motivating factor to improve quality both in RSBI and neighboring schools,</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Continue to serve as an entry point for international best practices without the difficult-to-achieve requirements that ISS adapt foreign curricula and receive foreign accreditation,</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Only require further modest investments by government by leveraging contributions from affluent parents and the business community,</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Impose sanctions to ensure at least 20% of students come from poor households and that these students are supported in RSBI.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This option requires significant changes in <a href=""https://mudarwan.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/permendiknas_nomor_78_tahun_2009_tentang_penyelenggaraan_sbi.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Ministerial Regulation 78/2009</a>, but not in the Law, such as removing the requirement to teach in English. The evaluation indicates that by removing contextually-related ISS compliance barriers, RSBI have can serve as the entry point and center for dissemination of much needed international best practices.</p>

<p>Initiation of an inter-directorate ISS Task Force to facilitate and oversee the consultations and drafting of the new ministerial policy regulation for ISS is also suggested. Another suggestion is to modify <a href=""https://mudarwan.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/permendiknas_nomor_78_tahun_2009_tentang_penyelenggaraan_sbi.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Ministerial Regulation 78/2009</a> as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Remove English as medium of instruction.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Remove OECD or other developed country accreditation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Remove OECD or other developed country curriculum adoption</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Review ISO Certificate Compliance</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Include OECD or other country curriculum as reference curriculum</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Add graduation requirement by adopting an international exam innovation</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also recommended to limit the fees charged in order to &ldquo;level the playing field&rdquo; and give more opportunities to the less affluent to enroll their children in RSBI. Provincial governments should be encouraged to support RSBI with their decentralization budgets. The lack of opportunities for disadvantaged children and children from lower socioeconomic strata is the major issues that needs to be addressed. The subsidies should be enough to cover all student needs including books, uniforms, and extra-curricular activities. Disadvantaged students encounter financial, academic&nbsp;and cultural barriers to participate in RSBI. &nbsp;These students should receive special remedial instruction in order to enable them to compete in RSBI schools.</p>

","Sekolah Berstandar Internasional (SBI)","<p>UU Pendidikan Nasional menetapkan Sekolah Berstandar Internasional untuk menyelenggarakan satuan pendidikan bertaraf internasional dalam rangka mempersiapkan siswa agar mampu bersaing di lapangan internasional. Tujuan UU No. 20/2003 adalah untuk membentuk standar pendidikan yang meliputi satuan bersandar internasional sebagai strategi untuk meningkatkan kualitas. UU mengenai Sekolah Berstandar Internasional&nbsp; dipertanyakan beberapa tahun terakhir ini dan saat ini sedang ditinjau oleh Mahkamah Konstitusi.</p>

<p>Kualifikasi SBI adalah bahwa sekolah harus memenuhi delapan Standar Nasional Pendidikan (SPN). Karakteristik&nbsp; dan persyaratan umum SBI menurut Peraturan Menteri 78/2009 adalah: (i) menggunakan bahasa Inggris sebagai pengantar dalam sains, matematika, dan mata pelajaran kejuruan; (ii) mengadopsi kurikulum dan standar akreditasi dari OECD atau negara maju lainnya; (iii) terakreditasi oleh sekolah dari OECD atau negara maju lainnya; terlibat dan berkolaborasi dengan luar negeri sebagai &ldquo;sister school &rdquo; ( iv) mewajibkan guru dan kepala sekolah memiliki gelar&nbsp; S2 (master) (v) memiliki fasilitas TIK yang lengkap; dan lain-lain</p>

<p>Ada sejumlah persepsi dan pemahaman stakeholder pada maksud pemerintah untuk mengadakan SBI di setiap &nbsp;kabupaten dan kota. Maksud ini memberi orang tua kemudahan akses untuk mempersiapkan anak-anak mereka untuk belajar di perguruan tinggi asing setelah sekolah menengah atas, untuk mempersiapkan siswa mendapatkan bekerja di luar negeri, serta untuk meningkatkan kualitas keseluruhan sekolah di Indonesia.</p>

<p>Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan telah memilih dan menyetujui beberapa sekolah yang dinamakan Rintisan Sekolah Bertaraf Internasional (RSBI). sebagai kandidat untuk menjadi SBI sepenuhnya. Sekolah dengan RSBI menerima dana tambahan untuk mendukung upaya mereka terhadap SBI dan terbebas dari kebijakan &ldquo; pendidikan gratis &rdquo; (Menteri SK 29/2007), sehingga sekolah RSBI dapat mengumpulkan dana dari orang tua (bayaran) untuk mendukung program standar internasional dan untuk kebutuhan sumber daya . Ada perbedaan pengelolaan dan praktek organisasi di tingkat pemerintah provinsi dan kabupaten, yang dapat dikelompokkan menjadi dua:</p>

<ol>
	<li>struktur organisasi yang memiliki unit khusus dan staf untuk mengelola dan mengelola RSBI</li>
	<li>struktur organisasi yang menetapkan tanggung jawab RSBI pada unit dan staf yang ada sebagai tanggung jawab tambahan.</li>
	<li>Sekolah yang dipilih untuk mengembangkan sekolah SBI adalah sekolah-sekolah terbaik diantara sekolah terbaik yang ada.
	<ul>
		<li>Sebagian besar sekolah terletak di daerah yang lebih makmur di kabupaten atau kota, sehingga orang tua bersedia membayar untuk biaya tambahan</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">Provinsi dan kota / kabupaten memantau penggunaan dana yang diterima oleh RSBI. Pemerintah provinsi memantau penggunaan dana yang &nbsp;disistribusikan ke sekolah-sekolah dari anggaran tahunan (APBD / Provinsi) serta memantau hibah untuk RSBI yang diterima dari Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan - tidak semua provinsi menerima blok hibah pada tahun tertentu. Pemerintah Kota /kabupaten memantau dana yang dialokasikan untuk sekolah RSBI yang berasal dari anggaran tahunan (APBD / Kota / Kabupaten) dan juga memantau penggunaan dana bahwa sekolah menerima langsung dari Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan.</span></span></p>

<p>Beberapa permasalahan menunjukan fakta bahwa pelatihan khusus RSBI terkait manajemen, administrasi, dan monitoring dan evaluasi belum diterima oleh pegawai provinsi dan kota / kabupaten yang bertanggung jawab mengelola RSBI. Pembicaraan tentang SBI biasanya terkait&nbsp; dengan beberapa permasalahan tentang pemerataan, akses&nbsp; dan kapasitas sekolah, serta apakah kebijakan tersebut didasarkan pada prinsip-prinsip dasar kualitas dan pemerataan akses yang memandu pendidikan di Indonesia. Program RSBI saat ini juga dianggap tidak terjangkau dan tidak ada satupun RSBIs telah mencapai status SBI.Pada kenyataaannya,&nbsp; Sangat sedikit diantaranya yang&nbsp; memenuhi standar. Persyaratan untuk mengajar dalam bahasa Inggris menjadi permasalahan bagi guru dan siswa untuk memahami materi.</p>

<p>Namun, kebijakan dan implementasi Program SBI bertujuan untuk meningkatkan standar pendidikan di sekolah tertentu dengan menerapkan langkah-langkah peningkatan kualitas dan menyediakan sumber daya terkait. Dengan melakukan evaluasi pada program SBI, pembuat kebijakan dan pemangku kepentingan pendidikan dapat menentukan apa yang dibutuhkan untuk peningkatan kualitas berkelanjutan dalam konteks pembangunan pendidikan di Indonesia, apa langkah-langkah pengembangan kualitas yang &nbsp;berjalan dalam konteks Indonesia, dan apa biaya peningkatan kualitas dari sisi keuangan dan sumber daya manusia.</p>

<p>Pilihan Kebijakan 1 - Mempertahankan kebijakan SBI sekarang</p>

<p>Investasi yang besar untuk program RSBI adalah untuk membangun infrastruktur, pengadaan peralatan dan melatih para guru dengan dana pemerintah yang signifikan (lebih Rp.1 triliun), serta jumlah biaya yang dibayarkan oleh orang tua dan sumbangan dari masyarakat dunia usaha. Siswa, personil sekolah, orang tua dan masyarakat berharap sekolah internasional tersedia di setiap kabupaten dan kota di negara ini. Biaya dan persepsi bahwa program ini adalah program pemerintah bersubsidi untuk &ldquo; elit. &rdquo; menjadi perhatian sejumlah pemangku kepentingan yang berpengaruh.</p>

<p>Pilihan kebijakan ini menyimpulkan bahwa standar untuk memilih sekolah yang memenuhi standar internasional belum efektif dalam meningkatkan pretasi siswa pada ujian nasional Indonesia. Sulit, mahal dan memakan waktu untuk memenuhi semua standar dan persyaratan untuk RSBI.</p>

<p>Pilihan Kebijakan 2 - Menghentikan Program RSBI</p>

<p>Tingginya biaya program dalam menyerap dana pemerintah dapat digunakan untuk kebutuhan yang lebih penting seperti membantu sekolah dan kabupaten dalam memenuhi SPM dan melaksanakan pendidikan dasar gratis sesuai dengan kebijakan saat ini. Investasi yang besar belum menunjukkan peningkatan prestasi siswa seperti dalam Ujian Nasional dimana hasil UN siswa RSBI rata-rata sama dengan mereka yang tidak menerima investasi untuk &nbsp;RSBI. Selain itu, &nbsp;peralatan mahal yang dibeli tidak digunakan secara efektif.</p>

<p>Program RSBI juga dikritik sudah mendiskriminasikan anak yang kurang beruntung dan anak-anak dari strata sosial ekonomi rendah. Anak-anak dari kelompok sosial ekonomi rendah cenderung memiliki prestasi akademik yang lebih rendah daripada mereka yang berasal dari kelompok sosial ekonomi yang lebih tinggi. Seringkali, siswa yang &nbsp;lebih makmur mengejek siswa yang kurang beruntung yang menerima subsidi dan perlakuan khusus.</p>

<p>Bukti menunjukkan adanya motivasi guru yang tinggi untuk meningkatkan pengajaran, belajar bahasa Inggris dan bekerja untuk maju. Sekolah lain telah termotivasi untuk meningkatkan kualitas pengajaran dengan harapan bahwa sekolah-sekolah ini mungkin suatu hari nanti masuk dalam program RSBI.</p>

<p>Penghentian program bisa berdampak negatif pada koherensi masyarakat dan motivasi peningkatan kualitas pendidikan di masa depan. Hal ini juga menimbulkan pemborosan &nbsp;investasi jika kebijakan tersebut dihentikan.</p>

<p>Pilihan kebijakan 3 - Memodifikasi Kebijakan dan Peraturan yang berlaku</p>

<p>Hasil evaluasi dan penelitian SBI saat ini mengidentifikasi bahwa kekurangan dapat diselesaikan dengan memodifikasi peraturan yang mendasari tanpa mengubah UU nomor 20/2003. Keuntungan dari pilihan ini adalah sebagai berikut:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mempertahankan dan memanfaatkan investasi yang diberikan melalui program RSBI,</li>
	<li>Tidak mengakibatkan kekecewaan dan berkurangnya motivasi karena penghentian mungkin berakibat di tingkat akar rumput dan terus menjadi faktor pendorong dalam meningkatkan kualitas di RSBI dan sekolah tetangga,</li>
	<li>Terus berperan sebagai titik awal praktik terbaik internasional tanpa kesulitan untuk mencapai persyaratan SBI mengadaptasi kurikulum asing dan menerima akreditasi asing, &nbsp;</li>
	<li>memerlukan investasi yang tidak besar dari pemerintah karena memanfaatkan kontribusi dari orang tua dan dari masyarakat bisnis,</li>
	<li>Menjatuhkan sanksi agar setidaknya 20% dari siswa berasal dari rumah tangga miskin dan bahwa siswa tersebut dibantu di RSBI.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pilihan ini membutuhkan perubahan signifikan dalam Peraturan Menteri 78/2009, tetapi tidak dalam UU, seperti menghapus persyaratan untuk mengajar dalam bahasa Inggris. Evaluasi menunjukkan bahwa dengan menghapus hambatan kontekstual terkait SBI, RSBI dapat berfungsi sebagai entry point dan pusat penyebaran praktik terbaik internasional.</p>

<p>Inisiasi gugus tugas SBI antar-direktorat untuk memfasilitasi dan mengawasi pembicaraan dan penyusunan peraturan kebijakan menteri baru tentang SBI juga disarankan. Saran lain adalah untuk memodifikasi Peraturan Menteri (Permen Diknas) Nomor 78/2009 sebagai berikut:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hapus bahasa Inggris sebagai bahasa pengantar.</li>
	<li>Hapus OECD atau akreditasi negara maju lainnya.</li>
	<li>Hapus OECD atau adopsi kurikulum negara maju lainnya</li>
	<li>Tinjau Pemenuhan terhadap Sertifikat ISO</li>
	<li>Sertakan OECD atau kurikulum negara lain sebagai kurikulum acuan</li>
	<li>Menambahkan syarat kelulusan dengan mengadopsi sebuah inovasi ujian internasional</li>
</ul>

<p>Hal ini juga dilakukan untuk membatasi biaya yang dikenakan dan memberikan lebih banyak kesempatan kepada yang kurang makmur untuk mendaftarkan anak Pemerintah provinsi harus didorong untuk mendukung RSBI dengan anggaran desentralisasi mereka. Kurangnya kesempatan untuk anak-anak yang kurang beruntung dan anak-anak dari strata sosial ekonomi rendah merupakan masalah utama yang perlu ditangani. Subsidi harus cukup untuk menutupi semua kebutuhan siswa termasuk buku, seragam, dan kegiatan ekstra kurikuler. Siswa yang kurang beruntung menghadapi hambatan keuangan, akademik, dan budaya untuk berpartisipasi dalam RSBI. Siswa-siswa ini harus menerima pengajaran remedial agar &nbsp;mampu bersaing di sekolah-sekolah RSBI.</p>

<p>Untuk memvalidasi keberadaan RSBI, standar akreditasi baru harus sesuai dengan orientasi / fokus internasional yang menetapkan kinerja yang lebih tinggi dari Standar Nasional akreditasi &ldquo; A &rdquo;. Manajer dan pelaksana program di sekolah kabupaten dan provinsi harus sepenuhnya memahami peraturan baru dan memiliki keterampilan yang dibutuhkan untuk memantau dan mengevaluasi kemajuan dalam memenuhi standar akreditasi baru dan untuk mengakses prestasi yang dibuat oleh RSBI.</p>

<p>Untuk meningkatkan kualitas, guru dan kepala sekolah harus berusaha untuk memfasilitasi dan mengelola peningkatan praktek mengajar seperti mengadopsi dan melatih metode baru, menemukan cara untuk mengintegrasikan siswa pada TIK, merumuskan rencana pengembangan profesi guru berdasarkan kolaborasi dengan rekan-rekan, refleksi diri dan evaluasi, dan menemukan cara untuk menumbuhkan komitmen secara teratur dan konsisten berbagi pengetahuan dan pengalaman praktis dengan rekan-rekan untuk perbaikan kualitas secara keseluruhan yang meliputi inklusi dan dukungan dari semua siswa, tidak peduli keadaan keuangan atau latar belakang sosial mereka. Kepala sekolah harus mengetahui dan menerapkan metode kepemimpinan yang meliputi tujuan jangka panjang pengembangan pribadi/profesional dan mengembangkan kinerja staf sekolah.</p>

"25","1","Student Health and Nutrition","<p dir=""ltr"">The Supplemental Food for School Children Program (PMT-AS) was launched to contribute to acceleration of achievement of national development goals related to: overcoming malnutrition (the incidence of stunting in children aged 6-14 years was 13.3 percent for boys and 10.9 percent for girls in 2010, according to Riskesdas); achieving education for all (primary school dropout rates in some provinces exceeded 3 percent, according to Kemendiknas in 2009); and poverty reduction (30 million Indonesians were below the national poverty line, according to Susenas in 2010).</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The PMT-AS Program was formulated to: (1) improve nutritional intake; (2) increase the physical endurance; (3) increase the attendance and learning interest; (4) increase preference for local nutritious food; (5) improve hygiene and healthy behaviors including healthy eating habits; (6) increase the community participation; and (7) increase community&rsquo;s income through the increased use of local products.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">During 2010 and 2011, the program was implemented by the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA). In 2010 the target was limited to regular and madrasah primary schoolchildren (SD/MI) grades 1-6, and in 2011 preschoolers (TK/RA) were added to the program. In 2011 the program was implemented in 27 districts in 27 provinces covering 1.2 million TK/SD children and 180,000 RA/MI children. The funding allocation for snack supplements for regular schools (TK/SD) for the western region was Rp 2,500 per serving and Rp 2,650 per serving for the eastern region. The unit cost for madrasah (RA/MI) was Rp 2,250 for the western region and Rp 2,600 for the eastern region. The total PMT-AS budget for 2011 was about Rp 300 billion (USD 34 million). The target scheduling for both years was 108 child feeding days (CFD). The program was intended to provide 15% of the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of calories (300 calories) and 10 percent of the RDA of protein (5 grams) through supplemental snacks prepared by local school personnel and community members.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The priority criteria for selecting districts in each province were: i) the less developed, remote, and island areas; ii) districts with a high percentage of poor people; and iii) districts with a high percentage of stunted children. <a href=""http://www.bphn.go.id/data/documents/97ip001.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Presidential Instruction 1/1997</a>&nbsp;was the legal basis of PMT-AS.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The evaluation of the effectiveness and impact of the PMT-AS Program was made by assessing the program&rsquo;s success in meeting the 16 indicators established for the evaluation. Program effectiveness was measured through assessment of indicators grouped under inputs, process and outputs. Program impact was assessed through a set of impact indicators that measure the extent to which the program has improved students&rsquo; overall health and nutrition, their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors relating to healthy living and the extent to which these conditions affect student academic performance and school attendance as well as the program&rsquo;s effects on the community as a whole.</p>

<p>Although PMT-AS Program was only implemented for two years (2010 and 2011), there is sufficient evidence that the program does have great potential value. However, failure to adhere to feeding schedules in practice resulted in under achievement of program objectives. The analysis strongly indicates that the program has not been fully implemented as intended primarily because delays in funds reaching the target location, i.e. the schools, and that in many cases the total funds reaching the school were not sufficient to provide supplements in accordance with the intended feeding schedule. and in the intended quantities because targets were set before the academic year began and the exact number of students enrolled was not yet known.</p>

<p>Funding allocations also did not take into account variability in costs and availability of locally procured products and ingredients. The evidence also indicates a lack of full understanding of nutrition on the part of program implementers in the schools which can be attributed in large part to inadequate training. Inadequate training also does not prepare the program implementers and managers to consider correct alternatives if the program&rsquo;s technical guidelines cannot be followed for various local reasons. The unavailability of funds specifically designated for management resulted in lack of coordination, monitoring, reporting. All these factors contribute to the lack of impact expected on improved nutrition.</p>

<p>The evaluation revealed a 35 percent deficit in consumption of calories in the 4 -12 age group in the schools surveyed (average 1,100 calories vs. RDA 1,750 calories) and a deficit of 20 percent in consumption of protein (32.3 g vs. RDA 39 grams). Therefore, the PMT-AS Program should be continued to provide assistance to make up the nutritional deficit of students. PMT-AS should be considered a strategic investment in developing Indonesian human resources. The following are nine recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the PMT-AS Program in the future:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Increase the amount of calories and protein to close the nutrition deficit gap;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Determine the most effective and efficient distribution of supplements;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Determine unit cost and frequency of supplements required to provide RDA calories and protein;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Produce legal regulation and alternative funding mechanism;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Streamline institutional arrangements , with MoEC as the lead sector at the center and District Education Offices (Dinas Pendidikan) at the provincial and district levels as lead sector in the regions. The coordination between key stakeholders such as MoRA, MoH and MoHA at all levels needs to be strengthened and their functions and roles should be more clearly specified;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Strengthen integration of health, nutrition and healthy lifestyle in the curriculum;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Revise selection criteria, define it by sub-districts with household poverty rates at 10 percent or more;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Improve training, guidelines and instruction manuals and strengthen MONEV;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Place more emphasis of importance of water and sanitation in PMT-AS program.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

"26","1","Education Financing","<p dir=""ltr"">Indonesia&rsquo;s two-part (MoEC and MoRA) funding passage makes basic education financing here rather complicated. <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=1"" target=""_blank"">Basic education</a> is mostly provided by the national education budget. 66% from MoEC, 28% MoRA, and the remaining 6% distributed to other ministries providing training and education. 60% of the national budget is transferred to sub-national governments by MoEC, while MoRA manages its fund allocation straight to schools. Another significant allocation is the school operational assistance grant (<em>bantuan operasional sekolah</em>/BOS), which is allocated to schools via the provincial offices. The BOS programme aimed to help the financial burden on families of sending their kids to school. Unfortunately, among its issues is the fact that although the grant is meant for development costs of a child, schools tend to use it to manage operational issues.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Improvements in MoEC&rsquo;s database have been made by giving unique numbers to individual students and identifiers for schools with their GPS coordinates to make an effective system for expenditure tracking. However, there are some issues with the efficient use of resources, such as the difficulty to know how money is being spent and identify where it goes. Planning and budget are more focused on the needs of the organizational units within the bureaucracy than the schools themselves; BOS and BOSDA allocations&rsquo; per-student formula does not take into account the differences in operating costs schools face due to the circumstances of, among others, their populations and locations.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">There are also some issues in equity, such as the fact that funding for private madrasah is unequal compared to funding for state schools, including state madrasah. Also, to enable greater allocative and technical efficiencies, the education financing still needs to be integrated and simplified. Equity concerns are being addressed by BOS and to a lesser extent the BSM.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Education financing encompasses very much every aspect of education. This section is therefore divided according to issues identified in <a href=""http://www.acdp-indonesia.org"" target=""_blank"">ACDP</a>&rsquo;s various studies.</p>

<p>Bantuan Operasional Sekolah (BOS), or School Operational Fund was introduced in 2005 as a program through which the Government of Indonesia, having legislated compulsory basic education, offered support to schools and madrasahs offering basic education programs. The program&#39;s specific focus has been on funds for schools&#39;/madrasahs&#39; operational non-personnel budgets. The program&#39;s introduction in 2005 was a result of the government&#39;s decision not to increase the country&#39;s fuel subsidy, but to direct the money saved in this way to programs which were more likely to help poorer sections of the community.</p>

<p>BOS fits into the broad structure of education funding in Indonesia, which consists of the following elements: &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>personnel funding to pay for salaries of teachers and school/madrasah support staff; &nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>minor investment funds for items such as school books, teaching aids and some equipment such as computers or generators; &nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>funds for major repairs of facilities and equipment; &nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>major capital investment; and &nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>operational non-personnel funds for goods and services needed by schools/madrasahs to deliver the educational program, including maintenance of facilities and equipment.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>For 2005 and 2006, there was a joint system for administration of the BOS program for both schools and madrasahs, but since 2007 this has been divided, with schools and madrasahs having separate administration systems. In all the years during which BOS funding has been provided, the payments have been made on the basis of student enrolment numbers.</p>

<p>Among issues associated with BOS, was the fact that an examination of the 13 components permitted to be funded shows that they are not always defined in a way which reflects BOS&#39;s objective of raising the quality of education. They merely describe some areas of activities and types of expenditure for which the funds can be used. Where the concern for quality is seen more clearly is in forms BOS-K1, and BOS-K7 used by schools/madrasahs to report planning and implementation based on their own annual programs. These documents demonstrate how the results of self-evaluation are translated into plans and actions designed to bridge the gap between the current position of the educational institutions and the quality standard as defined by either MSS or NES. This documentation format also allows the recording of judgement as to how effectively the program to bridge the gap is being implemented. The gap analysis itself and school and madrasah targets to bridge the gap are not required by BOS Juknis.</p>

<p>Using this format of planning and reporting means that schools/madrasahs still have the additional, previously-existing requirement of reporting their expenditure by the 13 cost components of BOS - such as honorariums, consumables and services - but this reporting can be done in a simple format. Since its primary purpose is informing key local stakeholders, it can be done in a format suitable for display on a notice-board. Schools/madrasahs may also choose to display a report on expenditure in this simplified format, though they are not required to do so.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the cost components of BOS funding, as listed, are not of a uniform kind. Some are types of activities, while other are payments for types of goods or services. The activities which are specified do not cover all the activities which could need to be undertaken to achieve either MSS or NES. They also do not cover all possible activities which are to be found in school/madrasah planning and budgeting documents. This adds considerable complexity to the required bookkeeping, accounting and reporting at school/madrasah level, effectively establishing two accountability systems which are at least partially disconnected.</p>

<p>Several alternatives are available for overcoming the difficulties associated with planning and reporting processes and formats.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Planning for and reporting on each standard to include itemisation of activities. It should be noted that this is already the requirement, but indications are that the instructions are often not complied with by most schools/madrasahs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Planning for and reporting on each standard but without itemisation of activities. Although this approach has not previously been used in school/madrasah long-term and annual planning documents, it should not cause difficulties for principals, being a relatively simple exercise. It is less complex than alternative 1, above.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>By the 13 components of BOS: (a) Separately from plans to achieve required quality standard, either MSS or NES. No budgeting per activity. Previously done without difficulties, but the cost components should be revised to exclude all &ldquo;activities&rdquo; from the cost components; (b) Planning for each standard to include itemisation of activities and cost components, budgeting of and reporting on cost components (type of expenditures); (c) Separate from planning for achievement of standard. Includes activities but not budgets. The budget can be presented separately, arranged by type of expenditure or by BOS cost component. Previously done without difficulties.; (d) The BOS components are included as part of the plan for achievement of standard. This has not been done previously in this integrated way, and would present some difficulties.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>It would appear that the best option may be one similar to option 3.c, if a free simple software (for example ACDP 006 Template) is provided to schools and madrasahs with access to electricity and computers. Otherwise option 2 would be the best. It would involve the production of two separate planning and reporting instruments, but it would help to provide a comprehensive planning process for the schools/madrasahs, as well as providing the system with information which it does not currently have.</p>

<p><strong>Improving Targeting Mechanism </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The impact of BSM is least at the elementary level. Expect for cases in poor remote areas and in some urban areas, children will go to SD/MI with or without BSM. National participation rate is about 95%. Causes of poor elementary attendance may be due in part to non-financial factors, such as the case in Papua where the school has not been operating for three months although some students received BSM.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The data indicate that about 72% of the very poor (as defined by the survey) received BSM while only about 50% of the near poor (again as defined by the survey) received BSM. A great deal of resentment was expressed especially by those who do not receive BSM although they are of the same poverty levels as those who do. A very small portion of BSM is awarded to the middle-upper financial classes. Although the number is small, people know this. Thus, many survey respondents question the accuracy and transparency of the program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students do not know whether or not they will receive BSM until they have enrolled in school. This has an impact especially on transitioning students. For example, a student from a very poor family who has graduated from elementary school may not even register for junior secondary because the costs are prohibitive. However, if the student knew in grade 6 that he/she would receive BSM in junior secondary there is a greater likelihood that the student would make the transition. This appears to be the reasoning for the present TNP2K policy to provide BSM to students in class 1 and class 7 in order to encourage transition. (However, as discussed below this message must be much better socialized.)</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Improving Right Sizing</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>All respondents in ACDP&rsquo;s study stated that BSM amounts should be increased, but there is a wide variation in the amounts suggested. The policy issue to be considered is the extent to which BSM is to cover the expenses for schooling. The current BSM amounts which were increased significantly beginning in 2013 show that BSM covers about 69%-72% of state basic education costs and 56%-64% for state madrasah, while BSM covers about 46%-66% for private general schools and 74%-100% for private madrasah. The analysis of the survey data suggests that current BSM funds could be increased for the very poor, especially those 5% of elementary and 22% of junior secondary aged students not currently enrolled in school.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>At the basic elementary level, the targeting of BSM appears to be more pressing than the amounts, especially for private madrasah. However, although specific quantitative data was not available for senior secondary, the qualitative data indicated that expenses are very high and the BSM at Rp1,200,000/year is not sufficient to cover the costs of fees and other expenses. This is a serious concern considering that that are about 240,000 senior secondary dropouts per year; and because the enrollment numbers are small, the teacher student ratio is very low which makes the system inefficient.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>&ldquo;One size does not fit all.&rdquo; There is a wide variation in the cost of living and hence the cost of schooling across the country as indicated by various data sets produced by Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS)). Several respondents mentioned that the amount of BSM should be adjusted to the cost of living in each region. It would seem that this would be more effective and more cost efficient than provide the same amount everywhere.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BSM Impact</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Late BSM funds distribution has a negative impact on the program because students need money at the beginning of the school year to buy uniforms, supplies, pay for transport and in some cases pay fees and tuition They also need disbursements at the beginning of the second semester to refresh supplies and pay fees where required. (Many respondents favor two disbursements per year vs. one payment.) Cases are reported of students being criticized or ridiculed because they have not paid their fees because the BSM was late in coming. Cases were reported of BSM distributions being made in the month of May for the school year that began in July the previous year.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The greatest portion of BSM funds is used for buying uniforms, especially at the elementary and junior secondary level (fees are the biggest expense at senior secondary). Cases was found in a number of sample districts where students are required to buy up to five sets of uniforms for elementary school and six sets for secondary.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The survey data indicate that dropout rates are manageable over the past three years in which the BSM program has been operating, with the exception of Papua region where the dropout rates remain much higher compared with the rest of the country. While the vast majority of principals and teachers believe BSM has reduced dropout rates and improved attendance, less than 50% of parents and students confirm this. At the time of the survey, only small portions of the new increased BSM amounts were disbursed; thus, it was too soon to determine if the new BSM rates will improve parents&rsquo; and students&rsquo; attitudes toward dropout and attendance.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>There were almost universal complaints about BSM disbursement procedures. The current practice of disbursement through banks is problematic especially for those who live far from the disbursing bank. The administrative requirements are difficult for some to follow; sometimes several trips have to be made in order to produce the proper paperwork; students often need to make an initial deposits in order to open an account which is a burden on poor families; travel to and from the bank is expensive in terms of money and time (in a case in Papua the trip to and from the bank had to be made by boat which took three days to make the trip) and especially for elementary school students someone from the school needs to accompany them.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The 2013-2014 BSM Guidelines (Juknis) issued jointly by the Directorate Generals of Basic and Senior Secondary Education clearly state that students&rsquo; BSM funds should not be cut by anyone. However, many cases of this happening were reported in the survey. The Guidelines also state that the principal can collect the funds on behalf of the students if it is too difficult for the students to travel to the disbursing agency. However, there is no mention in the Guidelines how the transportation costs for collecting the funds are to be covered. In some remote places the transportation costs are substantial. Most district government officials (Dinas Pendidikan) and principals strongly recommended management and administration funds be allocated to cover such expenses.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BSM and Accessibility Issues</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Socialization of the BSM and KPS programs is severely lacking. Several survey respondents, especially parents and village heads, did not understand that KPS could be used to apply for BSM. A number of school principals were unclear about some of the regulations. For example the principal of a vocational school specializing in agribusiness was unaware that the Directorate of Vocational Education issued guidelines that all students in agribusiness vocational schools are eligible for BSM because he had not received the guidelines at the time of the survey in mid-October 2013. Essentially no respondents knew about MOEC&rsquo;s complain BSM center or how to lodge complaints.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>KPS and BSM cards which were derived from the TNP2K national database were the main criteria for nominating BSM beneficiaries. However, the survey could determine that only about 51% of the BSM beneficiaries used these documents to apply for BSM. Nearly 50% used poverty certificates (SKTM) issued by the village government or were classified as fatherless children or orphans or other factors applied such as political pressures. The survey could not determine whether or not those who used SKTM were included in the TNP2K national database but did not receive KPS.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The transparency and accountability in issuing the SKTM were questioned. Some cases were reported where the village authorities issued SKTM to anyone who asked, whether they are poor or not; and in some cases fees were charged for issuing SKTM. Thus, school authorities are suspicious of the motives of the village heads, and at the same time the village heads stated they are the ones who know who is poor and not and so should be involved in the BSM targeting. Suggestions were made to form a task force comprised of village and school officials and school committee members to validate the poverty status of those targeted for BSM.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Several cases of political intervention were reported. Politicians said that they were given a certain number of BSM to distribute. There are cases where the students were only given one-half of the amounts they deserved.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Improving the provision of scholarships for the poor in the future </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>A greater role for the province should be considered. Provincial authorities consulted in the survey said they are left out of the process but are willing to help if regulations are drafted to define their role in the BSM program. For example, one district in the Kalimantan region could not fulfill its BSM quota. If the province was given a coordination role, the province could redistribute quotas according to supply and demand. The province could also help to monitor targeting, validating poverty data, and program implementation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>MORA has a mechanism that appears to be complex. BSM for state schools is included in the routine budget (under &ldquo;Program&rdquo;), while BSM for private madrasah appear under a separate budget category (&ldquo;Bantuan&rdquo;). Recommendations were made that MORA and MOEC use the same mechanism for targeting, budgeting and programing BSM.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The Papua-West Papua region has needs that are different and greater than the rest of the country. Data indicate for example that dropout rates are greater in Papua compared with other regions. The lack of infrastructure and poor teacher management in addition to overall under socio-economic development especially in the rural regions, require special attention and special BSM policies.</p>

<div class=""collapsible-item-body panel-body"">
<p>The Survey of Parent Contributions to Basic Education was required as a deliverable of ACDP&#39;s report titled&nbsp;&quot;Free Basic Education Strategy&quot;. Its draft methodology and instruments were approved as a part of the project&#39;s Inception Report. The sample size of the survey, as proposed in the Inception Report, was to include 4,032 parents from 336 schools/madrasahs in 14 districts/cities. Budgetary constraints resulted in the sample having to be reduced to 2,781 parents in 228 schools/madrasahs in 10 districts/cities.</p>

<p>The study was carried out to establish the education-related costs borne by parents of children in basic education. In addition, data gathered from the schools/madrasahs in the sample included information about their total budgets and total contributions received from parents during the 2010/2011 school year, as well as information about how these funds were used.</p>

<p>By utilising data from the Education and Social Module of the National Economic and Social Survey (Susenas), the study was also able to analyse the trends in parental contributions over time, and the effect of the provision of School Operational Funding (BOS) on parents&rsquo; expenditure in educating their children. The Education and Social Module is administered every three years, with the most recent one administered in 2009. Data for years 2003, 2006, and 2009 were analysed to determine overall trends in parents&rsquo; contributions over time including an analysis of the change in subsets of the expenses such as fees, uniforms, snacks and transport.</p>

<p>The survey found, among others, that parents in all types of schools/madrasahs made substantial contributions to the cost of providing basic education to their children (Tables 5 and 6, below). Costs of junior secondary students were generally higher than those of primary students, except for students in private MTs&#39;s, who tend to come from the lowest socio-economic strata of Indonesian society. The highest categories of cost incurred by all parents were pocket money, student transport and uniforms. School fees were a major expenditure item in secondary schools/madrasahs, with those in private SMPs being the highest, followed by government MTs. The cost of pocket money may appear high, but it is common in Indonesia for parents to give children money to buy a &quot;snack&quot; on a school day. There is no mandated number of days on which Indonesian children have to attend school, but given an average of around 200 effective school days in a year, the average value of pocket money given to a student on a school day ranges from approximately Rp 4,900 in government MTs to Rp 2,200 in private MIs.</p>

<p>Another finding was the fact that willingness of parents to make contributions was highest among schools/madrasahs with highest level of national accreditation (A), and lowest among those with lowest accreditation (C), probably indicating that the perceived quality of a school/madrasah has an impact in this regard. Parents from all schools/madrasahs indicated that among budget items to which they were prepared to contribute, teacher wages and incentives rated very highly. The only items rated more highly were laboratories for SMPs. These also rated highly among parents of MTs&#39;s, both private and government. Student excursions and books for libraries generally rated lowest.</p>

<p>The current funding of government senior secondary education is complex and varies throughout the country. It involves different levels of government providing financial support for infrastructure, salaries and operational costs. A common feature of the senior secondary sub-sector is its dependence on parental contributions. This has implications for school quality and for equity. The government&rsquo;s policy of designating some schools as &lsquo;international standard secondary schools&rsquo; (RSBI) has inadvertently adversely affected equity.</p>

<p>The ACDP study found considerable variation in the levels of cost and the amounts of available revenue among state senior secondary schools (SMA), with the RSBI being far better resourced than the rest. Salaries of government service teachers (PNS) are the responsibility of government. Those of teachers without PNS status, who are numerous in some schools, have to be paid for from other sources and almost invariably these costs fall on parents. The burden on parents comes in various forms. There are direct charges for fees and registration books and uniforms and there are indirect costs of transport and meals. There are also high opportunity costs of sending children to senior secondary school to set against the perceived returns of this level of schooling.</p>

<p>In seeking a more rational funding arrangement for senior secondary education, a number of important policy issues were raised. These concern the relative responsibilities of different levels of government for senior secondary education and the nature and magnitude of parental contributions. These issues need to be addressed in the knowledge that Government finances are limited and that decisions need to be made on the &ldquo;desired&rdquo; level of user charges, because the private returns to this level of education are high. Such decisions will have implications for social policy and the government&rsquo;s stated intention of extending access to all. It also raises questions about the efficacy of efforts to reduce the cost burden for poor families through selective government subsidies and other pro-poor schemes.</p>

<p>There are efforts at various levels of government to support an expansion of senior secondary education. The central government is supporting investment in school building and subsidising operational costs through BOMM (grant assistance for quality and management) and an extension of per-capita school grants (BOS). It also promotes participation of poor students through scholarships (BKMM). District governments have introduced schemes to provide revenue to schools and reduce the burden of school fees. Some are also increasing enrolments through innovative school structures, such as the filial schools in Grobogan and Karawang.</p>

<p>There are also policy options that cover, among others, &nbsp;the need for greater supply of places, both for the currently projected rise in the number of children graduating from junior secondary schools and for an extra 260,000 children who will need to be enrolled if the 85% target is to be reached in the next two years. Reliance on school building to meet the challenge will not be sufficient, because of the very high costs involved and the limited time available. Other approaches are examined. These include structural innovations, such as the grouping of schools to reap economies of scale and overcome geographical obstacles. The filial schools model is one such example, but there are also other models in operation in other countries. These include the use of distance learning and the application of new technology. Increased efficiency, particularly in the major cost item, the use of teachers, would be a source of major savings which would free up resources for expansion. In order to reap efficiency gains the government needs to look critically at student-teacher ratios, which are very low, and teachers&rsquo; time on task. Teacher absenteeism and the practice of having several jobs mean that unit costs are much higher than they need to be.</p>

<p>The majority of the private madrasah are far behind state schools/madrasah in meeting MSS. This ACDP study provides the following preliminary estimates of costs for private madrasah to meet only certain MSS: MI require Rp 1.5 trillion for infrastructure rehabilitation, Rp 340 billion for teachers rooms and furniture, Rp 41 billion for lab equipment and books; MTs require Rp 920 billion for infrastructure rehabilitation and Rp 2.3 trillion for lab equipment and books. Further, perhaps the greatest issue to address and to cost is that of private madrasah teachers. Just gathering the data upon which to calculate financial resources needed will be challenging considering that such data from MoRA to date has not been adequate for planning needs at the national level.</p>

<p>It should be noted that some private madrasah are not operating efficiently or effectively and continued government funding to these institutions should be reconsidered. For example, a private junior secondary madrasah (MTs) in Buleleng, Bali has a total of 43 students which requires nearly Rp 300 million per year to operate at absolute minimum standards. This institution could be merged with other nearby schools; it does not serve an isolated community.</p>

<p>The main funding source for both state and private madrasah is the government with smaller contributions from the community. The proportions of government and community funding for private MI is 75:25, for private MTs 70:30, and for private MA 42:58. While this analysis demonstrates that private madrasah are very dependent on the government for funding, it does not address the issue concerning the adequacy of the funding for private madrasah nor the unequal allocation of MoRA budgets for madrasah education.</p>

<p>Government funding for state MI was on average five times greater than government funding for private MI. Central MoRA was the major source of government funding, while local governments made relatively minor contributions. Madrasah are by law part of the National Education System. They make a significant contribution to meeting district enrollment standards (APM/APK) and Human Development Index targets (IPM). Madrasah (MI) take about 11% of primary school enrollments and 22% of junior secondary enrollments (MTs). The vast majority of madrasah are private. While the local governments depend heavily on madrasah to help them meet enrollment standards, they are constrained from providing financial support because of prevailing laws and regulations that prohibit them from funding madrasah on a regular basis, specifically Law 32/2004 concerning local government, Government Regulation (GR) No. 38/2007 concerning division of authority among levels of government, and MoHA Regulation (Permendagri) 32/2011 concerning grants and social assistance.</p>

<p>Funding mechanisms especially at the local level are inconsistent. In some places because the Office of Education could not (or would not) fund private madrasah, the Peoples Welfare Office (Kesra) located in the regional Secretariat provides support in the form of Social Donations. Although there is the desire on the part of some local governments to provide more support to private madrasah, they feel constrained by current regulations, especially those under MoHA.</p>

<p>In conclusion, private madrasah cannot rely on community funding if they are to achieve MSS and eventually NES, and therefore the total overall performance of education is severely negatively affected since private madrasah make such a large contribution to district enrollments. Therefore, additional government funds are required to enable private madrasah improve the quality of education. The current legal framework and funding mechanisms under decentralization must be modified to allow better coordination and management of basic education at the district level.</p>

<p>The recommendations are made in full awareness that a tremendous amount of new additional funding will be required to enable both state and private madrasah to meet MSS and later NES. The recommendations are also made with the awareness that revisions in current regulations will be required which will involve the highest levels of government (DPR, MoHA, MoF, BAPPENAS, MoEC, MoRA and MenPAN among others) as well as public consultations. Considering the sensitivity of the issues, these debates could be contentious. Nevertheless, the issues identified in the study are pressing and at some point in time demand attention. The alternative policy instruments outlined here are based on careful analysis of a great quantity of data and stakeholder input and are meant as a contribution to the continuing dialog among the public and government in regard to improving Indonesian education, with a particular emphasis on the role of madrasah in the national education system.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Revise laws and regulations to enable local governments to contribute towards funding of madrasah, particularly private madrasah</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Create a special arrangement whereby management of madrasah basic education (MI/MTs) is deconcentrated to local government</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Deconcentrate madrasah education management to provincial and district MoRA offices which then contract madrasah basic education to community institutions</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Improve funding equity between public and private madrasah</p>

","Pembiayaan Pendidikan","<p>Pendanaan yang terbagi menjadi dua bagian (Kemendikbud dan Kemenag) di Indonesia membuat proses pembiayaan pendidikan menjadi relatif rumit. Sebagian besar pembiayaan pendidikan dasar diberikan oleh anggaran pendidikan nasional. 66% dari Kemendikbud, 28% Kemenpag, dan 6% sisanya didistribusikan ke kementerian lain yang memberikan pelatihan dan pendidikan. 60% dari anggaran nasional dialihkan ke pemerintah daerah oleh Kemenakertrans, sementara Kemenag mengelola alokasi dana langsung ke sekolah. Alokasi signifikan lainnya adalah bantuan operasional sekolah (BOS), yang dialokasikan ke sekolah-sekolah melalui kantor provinsi. Program BOS bertujuan untuk membantu beban keuangan keluarga anak-anak mereka ke sekolah. Sayangnya, di antara isu-isu tersebut adalah kenyataan bahwa walaupun hibah dimaksudkan untuk biaya pengembangan anak, sekolah cenderung menggunakannya untuk mengelola masalah operasional.</p>

<p>Perbaikan dalam database Kemendikbud telah dibuat dengan memberikan nomor unik kepada siswa perorangan dan pengidentifikasi untuk sekolah dengan koordinat GPS mereka untuk membuat sistem pelacakan pengeluaran yang efektif. Namun, ada beberapa masalah dengan penggunaan sumber daya yang efisien, seperti kesulitan untuk mengetahui bagaimana uang digunakan dan mengidentifikasi tujuannya. Perencanaan dan anggaran lebih difokuskan pada kebutuhan unit organisasi di dalam birokrasi daripada di sekolah itu sendiri; Formula per-siswa BOS dan BOSDA tidak memperhitungkan perbedaan biaya operasi yang dihadapi sekolah karena keadaan, antara lain, populasi dan lokasi mereka.</p>

<p>Ada juga beberapa masalah dalam ekuitas, seperti fakta bahwa dana untuk madrasah swasta tidak adil dibandingkan dengan pendanaan untuk sekolah negeri, termasuk madrasah negara bagian. Selain itu, untuk memungkinkan efisiensi alokasi dan teknis yang lebih besar, pembiayaan pendidikan masih perlu diintegrasikan dan disederhanakan. Masalah ekuitas ditangani oleh BOS dan pada tingkat yang lebih rendah BSM.</p>

<p>Pembiayaan pendidikan mencakup hampir semua aspek pendidikan. Oleh karena itu, bagian ini dibagi berdasarkan isu-isu yang diidentifikasi dalam berbagai penelitian ACDP.</p>

<p>Bantuan Operasional Sekolah (BOS), atau Dana Operasional Sekolah diperkenalkan pada tahun 2005 sebagai program dimana Pemerintah Indonesia telah menetapkan wajib belajar dasar, menawarkan dukungan kepada sekolah dan madrasah yang menawarkan program pendidikan dasar. Fokus khusus program ini adalah pada dana untuk anggaran non-personil operasional sekolah / madrasah. Pengenalan program pada tahun 2005 merupakan hasil keputusan pemerintah untuk tidak meningkatkan subsidi bahan bakar negara tersebut, namun untuk mengarahkan uang yang disimpan dengan cara ini ke program yang lebih cenderung membantu bagian masyarakat yang lebih miskin.</p>

<p>BOS sesuai dengan struktur pendanaan pendidikan yang luas di Indonesia, yang terdiri dari unsur-unsur berikut:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pendanaan personil untuk membayar gaji guru dan staf pendukung sekolah / madrasah;</li>
	<li>Dana investasi kecil untuk barang-barang seperti buku sekolah, alat peraga dan beberapa peralatan seperti komputer atau generator;</li>
	<li>Dana untuk perbaikan fasilitas dan peralatan utama;</li>
	<li>Investasi modal utama; dan</li>
	<li>Dana non-personil operasional untuk barang dan jasa yang dibutuhkan oleh sekolah / madrasah untuk memberikan program pendidikan, termasuk pemeliharaan fasilitas dan peralatan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Untuk tahun 2005 dan 2006, ada sistem gabungan untuk penyelenggaraan program BOS untuk sekolah dan madrasah, namun sejak 2007 ini telah dibagi, dengan sekolah dan madrasah memiliki sistem administrasi tersendiri. Selama tahun-tahun dimana dana BOS telah disediakan, pembayaran dilakukan berdasarkan nomor pendaftaran siswa.</p>

<p>Di antara masalah yang terkait dengan BOS, adalah kenyataan bahwa pemeriksaan terhadap 13 komponen yang diizinkan untuk didanai menunjukkan bahwa hal itu tidak selalu didefinisikan dengan cara yang mencerminkan tujuan BOS untuk meningkatkan kualitas pendidikan. Mereka hanya menggambarkan beberapa bidang kegiatan dan jenis pengeluaran dimana dana dapat digunakan. Bila perhatian terhadap kualitas terlihat lebih jelas adalah dalam bentuk BOS-K1, dan BOS-K7 digunakan oleh sekolah / madrasah untuk melaporkan perencanaan dan pelaksanaan berdasarkan program tahunan mereka sendiri. Dokumen-dokumen ini menunjukkan bagaimana hasil evaluasi diri diterjemahkan ke dalam rencana dan tindakan yang dirancang untuk menjembatani kesenjangan antara posisi institusi pendidikan saat ini dan standar kualitas seperti yang didefinisikan oleh MSS atau SPN. Format dokumentasi ini juga memungkinkan pencatatan penilaian mengenai seberapa efektif program untuk menjembatani kesenjangan sedang dilaksanakan. Analisis kesenjangan itu sendiri dan target sekolah dan madrasah untuk menjembatani kesenjangan tidak disyaratkan oleh BOS Juknis.</p>

<p>Dengan menggunakan format perencanaan dan pelaporan ini berarti bahwa sekolah / madrasah masih memiliki persyaratan tambahan yang sebelumnya ada untuk melaporkan pengeluaran mereka oleh 13 komponen biaya BOS - seperti honor, barang habis pakai dan layanan - namun pelaporan ini dapat dilakukan secara sederhana. format. Karena tujuan utamanya adalah menginformasikan pemangku kepentingan utama, hal itu dapat dilakukan dalam format yang sesuai untuk ditampilkan di papan pengumuman. Sekolah / madrasah juga dapat memilih untuk menampilkan laporan pengeluaran dalam format yang disederhanakan ini, walaupun mereka tidak diharuskan untuk melakukannya.</p>

<p>Perlu dicatat bahwa komponen biaya dana BOS, seperti yang tercantum, tidak sejenis. Beberapa jenis kegiatan, sementara lainnya adalah pembayaran untuk jenis barang atau jasa. Kegiatan yang ditentukan tidak mencakup semua kegiatan yang perlu dilakukan untuk mencapai MSS atau SPN. Mereka juga tidak mencakup semua kemungkinan kegiatan yang dapat ditemukan dalam dokumen perencanaan dan penganggaran sekolah / madrasah. Hal ini menambah kompleksitas yang cukup besar untuk pembukuan, akuntansi dan pelaporan yang diperlukan di tingkat sekolah / madrasah, yang secara efektif membangun dua sistem pertanggungjawaban yang setidaknya terputus sebagian.</p>

<p>Beberapa alternatif tersedia untuk mengatasi kesulitan yang terkait dengan proses dan format perencanaan dan pelaporan.</p>

<p>Merencanakan dan melaporkan setiap standar untuk memasukkan itemisasi kegiatan. Perlu dicatat bahwa ini sudah menjadi persyaratan, namun indikasi bahwa instruksi tersebut seringkali tidak sesuai dengan kebanyakan sekolah / madrasah.</p>

<p>Merencanakan dan melaporkan setiap standar namun tanpa itemisasi kegiatan. Meskipun pendekatan ini sebelumnya tidak pernah digunakan dalam dokumen perencanaan jangka panjang dan perencanaan sekolah / madrasah, hal itu seharusnya tidak menimbulkan kesulitan bagi kepala sekolah, karena latihannya relatif sederhana. Ini kurang kompleks dibanding alternatif 1, diatas.</p>

<p>Dengan 13 komponen BOS: (a) Secara terpisah dari rencana untuk mencapai standar kualitas yang dipersyaratkan, baik MSS maupun SPN. Tidak ada penganggaran per aktivitas. Sebelumnya dilakukan tanpa kesulitan, namun komponen biaya harus direvisi untuk mengecualikan semua &quot;aktivitas&quot; dari komponen biaya; (B) Merencanakan setiap standar untuk memasukkan itemisasi kegiatan dan komponen biaya, penganggaran dan pelaporan komponen biaya (jenis pengeluaran); (C) Pisahkan dari perencanaan pencapaian standar. Termasuk kegiatan tapi bukan anggaran. Anggaran dapat disajikan secara terpisah, disusun berdasarkan jenis pengeluaran atau komponen biaya BOS. Sebelumnya dilakukan tanpa kesulitan; (D) Komponen BOS dimasukkan sebagai bagian dari rencana pencapaian standar. Ini belum pernah dilakukan sebelumnya dengan cara terpadu ini, dan akan menimbulkan beberapa kesulitan.</p>

<p>Tampaknya pilihan terbaik mungkin sama dengan opsi 3.c, jika perangkat lunak sederhana yang gratis (misalnya Template ACDP 006) diberikan ke sekolah dan madrasah dengan akses ke listrik dan komputer. Kalau tidak pilihan 2 akan menjadi yang terbaik. Ini akan melibatkan produksi dua instrumen perencanaan dan pelaporan yang terpisah, namun akan membantu untuk menyediakan proses perencanaan yang komprehensif untuk sekolah / madrasah, serta menyediakan sistem dengan informasi yang saat ini tidak dimiliki.</p>

<p><strong>Memperbaiki Mekanisme Penargetan</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Dampak BSM paling sedikit di tingkat dasar. Berharap untuk kasus di daerah terpencil yang miskin dan di beberapa daerah perkotaan, anak-anak akan pergi ke SD / MI dengan atau tanpa BSM. Tingkat partisipasi nasional sekitar 95%. Penyebab kehadiran SD yang buruk mungkin disebabkan oleh faktor non-keuangan, seperti kasus di Papua dimana sekolah tersebut belum beroperasi selama tiga bulan meskipun beberapa siswa menerima BSM.</li>
	<li>Data menunjukkan bahwa sekitar 72% orang yang sangat miskin (seperti yang ditentukan oleh survei) menerima BSM sementara hanya sekitar 50% dari jumlah yang mendekati miskin (sekali lagi ditentukan oleh survei) menerima BSM. Banyak kebencian diungkapkan terutama oleh mereka yang tidak menerima BSM meski mereka memiliki tingkat kemiskinan yang sama dengan mereka yang melakukannya. Sebagian kecil BSM diberikan ke kelas keuangan menengah atas. Meski jumlahnya kecil, orang tahu ini. Dengan demikian, banyak responden survei mempertanyakan keakuratan dan transparansi program.</li>
	<li>Siswa tidak tahu apakah mereka akan menerima BSM sampai mereka mendaftar di sekolah. Hal ini berdampak terutama pada transisi siswa. Misalnya, seorang siswa dari keluarga yang sangat miskin yang telah lulus dari sekolah dasar bahkan mungkin tidak mendaftar untuk sekolah menengah pertama karena biayanya mahal. Namun, jika siswa mengetahui di kelas 6 bahwa dia akan menerima BSM di sekolah menengah pertama, ada kemungkinan lebih besar bahwa siswa tersebut akan melakukan transisi. Hal ini tampaknya menjadi alasan kebijakan TNP2K saat ini untuk menyediakan BSM kepada siswa kelas 1 dan kelas 7 untuk mendorong transisi. (Namun, seperti yang dibahas di bawah pesan ini harus disosialisasikan dengan lebih baik.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Meningkatkan Ukuran Kanan</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Semua responden dalam studi ACDP menyatakan bahwa jumlah BSM harus ditingkatkan, namun ada variasi yang luas dalam jumlah yang disarankan. Isu kebijakan yang harus dipertimbangkan adalah sejauh mana BSM menanggung biaya sekolah. Jumlah BSM saat ini meningkat secara signifikan mulai tahun 2013 menunjukkan bahwa BSM mencakup sekitar 69% -72% biaya pendidikan dasar negara dan 56% -64% untuk madrasah negara, sementara BSM mencakup sekitar 46% -66% untuk sekolah umum swasta dan 74% -100% untuk madrasah swasta. Analisis data survei menunjukkan bahwa dana BSM saat ini dapat ditingkatkan untuk masyarakat yang sangat miskin, terutama 5% siswa SD dan 22% siswa sekolah menengah pertama yang saat ini tidak terdaftar di sekolah.</li>
	<li>Pada tingkat dasar dasar, penargetan BSM nampaknya lebih menekan daripada jumlah, terutama untuk madrasah swasta. Namun, walaupun data kuantitatif tertentu tidak tersedia untuk data sekunder, data kualitatif menunjukkan bahwa biaya sangat tinggi dan BSM sebesar Rp1.200.000 / tahun tidak mencukupi untuk menutupi biaya biaya dan biaya lainnya. Ini adalah masalah serius mengingat sekitar 240.000 siswa putus sekolah menengah atas per tahun; Dan karena angka pendaftarannya kecil, rasio siswa guru sangat rendah sehingga membuat sistem tidak efisien.</li>
	<li>&quot;Satu ukuran tidak sesuai untuk semua.&quot; Ada variasi biaya hidup yang tinggi dan karenanya biaya sekolah di seluruh negeri ditunjukkan oleh berbagai perangkat data yang diproduksi oleh Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS)). Beberapa responden menyebutkan bahwa jumlah BSM harus disesuaikan dengan biaya hidup di masing-masing daerah. Tampaknya ini akan lebih efektif dan hemat biaya daripada memberikan jumlah yang sama di mana-mana.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dampak BSM</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Penyaluran dana BSM terlambat berdampak negatif pada program ini karena siswa membutuhkan uang pada awal tahun ajaran untuk membeli seragam, persediaan, membayar transportasi dan dalam beberapa kasus membayar uang sekolah dan biaya pendidikan juga memerlukan pencairan pada awal semester kedua. Untuk menyegarkan persediaan dan membayar biaya bila diperlukan. (Banyak responden menyukai dua pencairan per tahun vs. satu pembayaran). Kasus dilaporkan siswa dikritik atau diejek karena mereka belum membayar biayanya karena BSM terlambat datang. Kasus dilaporkan dari distribusi BSM yang dilakukan pada bulan Mei untuk tahun ajaran yang dimulai pada bulan Juli tahun sebelumnya.</li>
	<li>Sebagian besar dana BSM digunakan untuk membeli seragam, terutama di tingkat SD dan SMP (biaya adalah biaya terbesar di tingkat menengah atas). Kasus ditemukan di sejumlah kabupaten sampel dimana siswa diminta untuk membeli sampai lima set seragam untuk sekolah dasar dan enam set untuk sekolah menengah.</li>
	<li>Data survei menunjukkan bahwa angka putus sekolah dapat dikelola selama tiga tahun terakhir dimana program BSM telah berjalan, kecuali wilayah Papua dimana angka putus sekolah tetap jauh lebih tinggi dibandingkan dengan negara lainnya. Sementara sebagian besar kepala sekolah dan guru percaya bahwa BSM telah mengurangi tingkat putus sekolah dan meningkatkan kehadiran, kurang dari 50% orang tua dan siswa mengkonfirmasi hal ini. Pada saat survei, hanya sebagian kecil dari jumlah BSM yang baru meningkat yang dicairkan; Dengan demikian, terlalu dini untuk menentukan apakah tarif BSM baru akan memperbaiki sikap orang tua dan siswa terhadap orang putus sekolah dan kehadiran.</li>
	<li>Hampir ada keluhan universal tentang prosedur pencairan BSM. Praktik pencairan saat ini melalui bank bermasalah terutama bagi mereka yang tinggal jauh dari bank disbursing. Persyaratan administrasi sulit untuk diikuti beberapa orang; Terkadang beberapa perjalanan harus dilakukan agar bisa menghasilkan dokumen yang benar; Siswa sering perlu membuat simpanan awal untuk membuka rekening yang membebani keluarga miskin; Perjalanan ke dan dari bank mahal dalam hal uang dan waktu (dalam kasus di Papua perjalanan ke dan dari bank harus dilakukan dengan kapal yang memakan waktu tiga hari untuk melakukan perjalanan) dan terutama bagi siswa sekolah dasar seseorang dari Sekolah perlu menemani mereka.</li>
	<li>Panduan BSM 2013-2014 (Juknis) yang dikeluarkan bersama oleh Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Dasar dan Menengah dengan jelas menyatakan bahwa dana BSM siswa tidak boleh dipotong oleh siapapun. Namun, banyak kasus kejadian ini dilaporkan dalam survei. Pedoman tersebut juga menyatakan bahwa kepala sekolah dapat mengumpulkan dana tersebut atas nama siswa jika terlalu sulit bagi siswa untuk melakukan perjalanan ke agen penyaluran dana. Namun, tidak ada yang menyebutkan dalam Pedoman bagaimana biaya transportasi untuk mengumpulkan dana harus ditutup. Di beberapa tempat terpencil biaya transportasi sangat besar. Sebagian besar pejabat pemerintah kabupaten / kota sangat menyarankan dana pengelolaan dan administrasi dialokasikan untuk menutupi biaya tersebut.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Masalah BSM dan Aksesibilitas</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Sosialisasi program BSM dan KPS sangat kurang. Beberapa responden survei, terutama orang tua dan kepala desa, tidak mengerti bahwa KPS dapat digunakan untuk mengajukan permohonan BSM. Sejumlah kepala sekolah tidak jelas tentang beberapa peraturan. Misalnya, kepala sekolah kejuruan yang mengkhususkan diri pada agribisnis tidak sadar bahwa Direktorat Pendidikan Kejuruan mengeluarkan pedoman agar semua siswa di sekolah kejuruan agribisnis memenuhi syarat untuk mendapatkan BSM karena dia belum menerima pedoman pada saat survei pada pertengahan Oktober 2013 Intinya tidak ada responden yang tahu tentang pusat BSM yang mengeluh tentang keluhan atau bagaimana mengajukan keluhan.</li>
	<li>Kartu KPS dan BSM yang berasal dari database nasional TNP2K merupakan kriteria utama untuk mencalonkan penerima manfaat BSM. Namun, survei tersebut dapat menentukan bahwa hanya sekitar 51% penerima manfaat BSM yang menggunakan dokumen ini untuk mengajukan permohonan BSM. Hampir 50% menggunakan sertifikat kemiskinan (SKTM) yang dikeluarkan oleh pemerintah desa atau diklasifikasikan sebagai anak yatim atau anak yatim atau faktor lain yang diterapkan seperti tekanan politik. Survei tersebut tidak dapat menentukan apakah mereka yang menggunakan SKTM termasuk dalam database nasional TNP2K namun tidak menerima KPS.</li>
	<li>Transparansi dan akuntabilitas penerbitan SKTM dipertanyakan. Beberapa kasus dilaporkan di mana otoritas desa mengeluarkan SKTM kepada siapa saja yang bertanya, apakah mereka miskin atau tidak; Dan dalam beberapa kasus biaya dikenakan untuk menerbitkan SKTM. Dengan demikian, otoritas sekolah mencurigai motif kepala desa, dan pada saat bersamaan kepala desa mengatakan bahwa mereka adalah orang-orang yang tahu siapa yang miskin dan tidak dan karenanya harus dilibatkan dalam penargetan BSM. Saran dibuat untuk membentuk gugus tugas yang terdiri dari pejabat desa dan sekolah dan anggota komite sekolah untuk memvalidasi status kemiskinan yang ditargetkan untuk BSM.</li>
	<li>Beberapa kasus intervensi politik dilaporkan. Politisi mengatakan bahwa mereka diberi sejumlah BSM untuk didistribusikan. Ada kasus dimana siswa hanya diberi setengah dari jumlah yang pantas mereka dapatkan.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Memperbaiki pemberian beasiswa bagi masyarakat miskin di masa yang akan datang</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Peran yang lebih besar untuk provinsi harus dipertimbangkan. Pihak berwenang provinsi yang dikonsultasikan dalam survei tersebut mengatakan bahwa mereka tidak terlibat dalam proses tersebut tetapi bersedia membantu jika peraturan disusun untuk menentukan peran mereka dalam program BSM. Misalnya, satu kabupaten di wilayah Kalimantan tidak dapat memenuhi kuota BSM-nya. Jika provinsi diberi peran koordinasi, provinsi tersebut dapat mendistribusikan kembali kuota sesuai dengan penawaran dan permintaan. Provinsi ini juga dapat membantu memantau penargetan, memvalidasi data kemiskinan, dan pelaksanaan program.</li>
	<li>Kemenristekdikti memiliki mekanisme yang nampaknya kompleks.&nbsp;BSM untuk sekolah negeri termasuk dalam anggaran rutin (di bawah &quot;Program&quot;), sementara BSM untuk madrasah swasta masuk dalam kategori anggaran (&quot;Bantuan&quot; yang terpisah). Rekomendasi dibuat bahwa Depag dan MOEC menggunakan mekanisme penargetan, penganggaran dan program BSM yang sama.</li>
	<li>Wilayah Papua-Papua Barat memiliki kebutuhan yang berbeda dan lebih besar dari negara lain. Data menunjukkan misalnya angka putus sekolah lebih besar di Papua dibandingkan dengan daerah lain. Kurangnya infrastruktur dan pengelolaan guru yang buruk disamping keseluruhan di bawah pembangunan sosial ekonomi terutama di daerah pedesaan, memerlukan perhatian khusus dan kebijakan BSM khusus.</li>

<p>Survei Kontribusi Orang Tua terhadap Pendidikan Dasar diperlukan sebagai penyampaian laporan ACDP berjudul &quot;Strategi Pendidikan Dasar Gratis&quot;. Draft metodologi dan instrumennya disetujui sebagai bagian dari Laporan Pendahuluan proyek. Ukuran sampel survei, seperti yang diusulkan dalam Laporan Pendahuluan, mencakup 4.032 orang tua dari 336 sekolah / madrasah di 14 kabupaten / kota. Kendala anggaran mengakibatkan sampel harus dikurangi menjadi 2.781 orang tua di 228 sekolah / madrasah di 10 kabupaten / kota.</p>

<p>Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk menetapkan biaya terkait pendidikan yang ditanggung oleh orang tua anak-anak dalam pendidikan dasar. Selain itu, data yang dikumpulkan dari sekolah / madrasah dalam sampel mencakup informasi tentang total anggaran dan total iuran yang diterima dari orang tua selama tahun ajaran 2010/2011, serta informasi tentang bagaimana dana tersebut digunakan.</p>

<p>Dengan memanfaatkan data dari Modul Pendidikan dan Sosial Survei Ekonomi dan Sosial Nasional (Susenas), penelitian ini juga dapat menganalisis kecenderungan kontribusi orang tua dari waktu ke waktu, dan pengaruh pemberian BOS terhadap orang tua &#39;Pengeluaran dalam mendidik anak-anaknya. Modul Pendidikan dan Sosial dikelola setiap tiga tahun, yang terakhir dikelola pada tahun 2009. Data untuk tahun 2003, 2006, dan 2009 dianalisis untuk menentukan kecenderungan keseluruhan kontribusi orang tua dari waktu ke waktu termasuk analisis perubahan himpunan bagian dari Biaya seperti biaya, seragam, makanan ringan dan transportasi.</p>

<p>Survei tersebut menemukan, antara lain, bahwa orang tua di semua jenis sekolah / madrasah memberikan kontribusi yang besar terhadap biaya penyediaan pendidikan dasar bagi anak-anak mereka (Tabel 5 dan 6, di bawah). Biaya siswa sekolah menengah pertama umumnya lebih tinggi daripada siswa sekolah dasar, kecuali siswa MTs swasta, yang cenderung berasal dari strata sosio-ekonomi terendah masyarakat Indonesia. Kategori biaya tertinggi yang dikeluarkan oleh semua orang tua adalah uang saku, transportasi pelajar dan seragam. Biaya sekolah merupakan barang pengeluaran utama di sekolah menengah / madrasah, dengan SMP swasta menjadi yang tertinggi, diikuti oleh MTs pemerintah. Biaya uang saku mungkin tampak tinggi, tapi sudah umum di Indonesia agar orang tua memberi anak uang untuk membeli &quot;makanan kecil&quot; pada hari sekolah. Tidak ada jumlah hari yang diamanatkan dimana anak-anak Indonesia harus bersekolah, namun rata-rata sekitar 200 hari sekolah efektif dalam setahun, nilai rata-rata uang saku yang diberikan kepada siswa pada hari sekolah berkisar antara sekitar Rp 4.900 di MTs pemerintah sampai Rp 2.200 di MIs swasta.</p>

<p>Temuan lain adalah kenyataan bahwa kesediaan orang tua untuk memberikan kontribusi paling tinggi di antara sekolah / madrasah dengan tingkat akreditasi nasional tertinggi (A), dan terendah di antara mereka yang memiliki akreditasi terendah (C), mungkin menunjukkan bahwa kualitas sekolah / madrasah yang dirasakan Memiliki dampak dalam hal ini. Orangtua dari semua sekolah / madrasah menunjukkan bahwa di antara item anggaran yang harus mereka kontribusikan, gaji guru dan insentif sangat tinggi. Satu-satunya barang yang dinilai lebih tinggi adalah laboratorium untuk SMP. Ini juga dinilai tinggi di kalangan orang tua MTs, baik swasta maupun pemerintah. Kunjungan mahasiswa dan buku untuk perpustakaan umumnya dinilai paling rendah.</p>

<p>Pendanaan saat ini untuk pendidikan menengah atas pemerintah sangat kompleks dan bervariasi di seluruh negeri. Ini melibatkan berbagai tingkat pemerintahan yang memberikan dukungan finansial untuk infrastruktur, gaji dan biaya operasional. Ciri umum dari sub sektor sekunder adalah ketergantungannya pada kontribusi orang tua. Ini berimplikasi pada kualitas sekolah dan keadilan. Kebijakan pemerintah untuk menunjuk beberapa sekolah sebagai &#39;sekolah menengah standar internasional&#39; (RSBI) telah secara tidak sengaja mempengaruhi keadilan.</p>

<p>Studi ACDP menemukan variasi yang cukup besar dalam tingkat biaya dan jumlah pendapatan yang tersedia di antara sekolah menengah pertama negeri, dengan RSBI memiliki sumber daya yang jauh lebih baik daripada yang lainnya. Gaji guru pelayanan pemerintah (PNS) merupakan tanggung jawab pemerintah. Guru tanpa status PNS, yang banyak di beberapa sekolah, harus dibayar dari sumber lain dan hampir selalu biaya ini jatuh pada orang tua. Beban pada orang tua datang dalam berbagai bentuk. Ada biaya langsung untuk biaya dan buku pendaftaran dan seragam dan ada biaya transportasi dan makan tidak langsung. Ada juga biaya kesempatan yang tinggi untuk mengirim anak ke sekolah menengah atas untuk menentukan tingkat pengembalian yang dirasakan dari tingkat sekolah ini.</p>

<p>Dalam mencari pengaturan pendanaan yang lebih rasional untuk pendidikan menengah atas, sejumlah isu kebijakan penting diangkat. Hal ini menyangkut tanggung jawab relatif berbagai tingkat pemerintahan untuk pendidikan menengah atas dan sifat dan besarnya kontribusi orang tua. Isu-isu ini perlu ditangani dengan pengetahuan bahwa keuangan pemerintah terbatas dan keputusan harus dibuat berdasarkan tingkat biaya yang &quot;diinginkan&quot;, karena tingkat pengembalian pribadi sampai tingkat pendidikan tinggi. Keputusan tersebut akan berimplikasi pada kebijakan sosial dan niat pemerintah untuk memperluas akses terhadap semua. Hal ini juga menimbulkan pertanyaan tentang keefektifan upaya untuk mengurangi beban biaya bagi keluarga miskin melalui subsidi pemerintah selektif dan skema pro-poor lainnya.</p>

<p>Ada berbagai upaya di berbagai tingkat pemerintahan untuk mendukung perluasan pendidikan menengah atas. Pemerintah pusat mendukung investasi di gedung sekolah dan mensubsidi biaya operasional melalui BOMM (pemberian bantuan untuk kualitas dan manajemen) dan perpanjangan hibah sekolah per kapita (BOS). Ini juga mendorong partisipasi siswa miskin melalui beasiswa (BKMM). Pemerintah kabupaten telah memperkenalkan skema untuk memberikan pendapatan ke sekolah dan mengurangi beban biaya sekolah. Beberapa juga meningkatkan pendaftaran melalui struktur sekolah yang inovatif, seperti sekolah berbakti di Grobogan dan Karawang.</p>

<p>Ada juga pilihan kebijakan yang mencakup, antara lain, kebutuhan akan pasokan tempat yang lebih banyak, baik untuk perkiraan jumlah anak yang lulus dari sekolah menengah pertama yang diproyeksikan saat ini, dan untuk tambahan 260.000 anak lagi yang perlu didaftarkan jika 85 % Target akan tercapai dalam dua tahun ke depan. Ketergantungan pada gedung sekolah untuk memenuhi tantangan tidak akan cukup, karena biaya yang sangat tinggi dan keterbatasan waktu yang tersedia. Pendekatan lainnya diperiksa. Ini termasuk inovasi struktural, seperti pengelompokan sekolah untuk menuai skala ekonomi dan mengatasi hambatan geografis. Model sekolah berbakti adalah salah satu contohnya, namun ada juga model lain yang beroperasi di negara lain. Ini termasuk penggunaan pembelajaran jarak jauh dan penerapan teknologi baru. Peningkatan efisiensi, terutama pada item biaya utama, penggunaan guru, akan menjadi sumber penghematan besar yang dapat membebaskan sumber daya untuk ekspansi. Untuk mendapatkan keuntungan efisiensi, pemerintah perlu melihat rasio siswa-guru secara kritis, yang sangat rendah, dan waktu tugas guru. Ketidakhadiran guru dan praktik memiliki beberapa pekerjaan berarti bahwa biaya unit jauh lebih tinggi daripada yang mereka butuhkan.</p>

<p>Mayoritas madrasah swasta jauh tertinggal dari sekolah negeri / madrasah dalam pertemuan dengan MSS. Studi ACDP ini memberikan perkiraan awal mengenai biaya untuk madrasah swasta untuk hanya memenuhi MSS tertentu: MI memerlukan Rp 1,5 triliun untuk rehabilitasi infrastruktur, Rp 340 miliar untuk ruang guru dan perabotan, Rp 41 miliar untuk peralatan dan buku laboratorium; MTs membutuhkan Rp 920 miliar untuk rehabilitasi infrastruktur dan Rp 2,3 triliun untuk peralatan dan buku laboratorium. Lebih jauh lagi, mungkin masalah terbesar yang harus ditangani dan biaya adalah guru madrasah swasta. Mengumpulkan data untuk menghitung sumber daya keuangan yang dibutuhkan akan sangat menantang mengingat data Depag tersebut sampai saat ini belum memadai untuk kebutuhan perencanaan di tingkat nasional.</p>

<p>Perlu dicatat bahwa beberapa madrasah swasta tidak beroperasi secara efisien atau efektif dan melanjutkan dana pemerintah ke institusi-institusi ini harus dipertimbangkan kembali. Misalnya, madrasah swasta swasta di Buleleng, Bali memiliki total 43 siswa yang membutuhkan dana hampir 300 juta rupiah per tahun untuk beroperasi pada standar minimum absolut. Lembaga ini bisa digabungkan dengan sekolah terdekat lainnya; Itu tidak melayani sebuah komunitas yang terisolasi.</p>

<p>Sumber pendanaan utama madrasah negeri dan swasta adalah pemerintah dengan kontribusi lebih kecil dari masyarakat. Proporsi dana pemerintah dan masyarakat untuk MI swasta adalah 75:25, untuk MTs swasta 70:30, dan untuk MA swasta 42:58. Sementara analisis ini menunjukkan bahwa madrasah swasta sangat bergantung pada pemerintah untuk pendanaan, namun tidak membahas masalah mengenai kecukupan dana untuk madrasah swasta atau alokasi anggaran Depag yang tidak merata untuk pendidikan madrasah.</p>

<p>Pendanaan pemerintah untuk MI negara rata-rata lima kali lebih besar daripada dana pemerintah untuk MI swasta. Depag Pusat adalah sumber utama pendanaan pemerintah, sementara pemerintah daerah memberikan kontribusi yang relatif kecil. Madrasah adalah bagian hukum dari Sistem Pendidikan Nasional. Mereka memberikan kontribusi yang signifikan untuk memenuhi target standar pendaftaran kabupaten / kota (APM / APK) dan Indeks Pembangunan Manusia (IPM). Madrasah (MI) mengambil sekitar 11% pendaftaran sekolah dasar dan 22% siswa sekolah menengah pertama (MTs). Sebagian besar madrasah bersifat pribadi. Sementara pemerintah daerah sangat bergantung pada madrasah untuk membantu mereka memenuhi standar pendaftaran, mereka dibatasi untuk memberikan dukungan finansial karena undang-undang dan peraturan yang berlaku yang melarang mereka mendanai sekolah secara reguler, khususnya UU 32/2004 tentang pemerintah daerah, peraturan pemerintah (GR) No. 38/2007 tentang pembagian kewenangan antar tingkat pemerintahan, dan Peraturan Menteri Kehakiman (Permendagri) 32/2011 tentang hibah dan bantuan sosial.</p>

<p>Mekanisme pendanaan terutama di tingkat lokal tidak konsisten. Di beberapa tempat karena Dinas Pendidikan tidak dapat (atau tidak) mendanai madrasah swasta, Kantor Kesra yang berada di Sekretariat daerah memberikan dukungan berupa Sumbangan Sosial. Meskipun ada keinginan dari beberapa pemerintah daerah untuk memberikan dukungan lebih kepada madrasah swasta, mereka merasa dibatasi oleh peraturan saat ini, terutama yang berada di bawah Depdagri.</p>

<p>Kesimpulannya, madrasah swasta tidak dapat mengandalkan dana masyarakat jika mereka ingin mencapai MSS dan pada akhirnya SEN, dan karena itu keseluruhan kinerja pendidikan sangat dipengaruhi secara negatif karena madrasah swasta memberikan kontribusi yang besar terhadap pendaftaran di tingkat kabupaten. Karena itu, tambahan dana pemerintah diharuskan memungkinkan madrasah swasta meningkatkan kualitas pendidikan. Kerangka kerja dan mekanisme pendanaan saat ini di bawah desentralisasi harus dimodifikasi untuk memungkinkan koordinasi dan pengelolaan pendidikan dasar yang lebih baik di tingkat kabupaten.</p>

<p>Rekomendasi tersebut dibuat dengan kesadaran penuh bahwa sejumlah dana tambahan baru akan diperlukan untuk memungkinkan madrasah negara bagian dan swasta untuk bertemu dengan MSS dan kemudian SEN. Rekomendasi tersebut juga dibuat dengan kesadaran bahwa revisi peraturan saat ini akan diperlukan yang akan melibatkan tingkat pemerintahan tertinggi (DPR, Depdagri, Kemenkeu, BAPPENAS, MoEC, Depag dan MenPAN antara lain) serta konsultasi publik. Mengingat kepekaan isu tersebut, perdebatan ini bisa jadi kontroversial. Namun demikian, isu-isu yang diidentifikasi dalam penelitian ini mendesak dan pada suatu waktu membutuhkan perhatian. Instrumen kebijakan alternatif yang diuraikan di sini didasarkan pada analisis mendalam tentang sejumlah besar masukan data dan pemangku kepentingan dan dimaksudkan sebagai kontribusi terhadap dialog berkelanjutan antara masyarakat dan pemerintah mengenai peningkatan pendidikan di Indonesia, dengan penekanan khusus pada peran Madrasah dalam sistem pendidikan nasional.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Merevisi undang-undang dan peraturan untuk memungkinkan pemerintah daerah memberikan kontribusi terhadap pendanaan madrasah, khususnya madrasah swasta</li>
	<li>Buat pengaturan khusus dimana pengelolaan pendidikan dasar madrasah (MI / MTs) didekonsentrasikan ke pemerintah daerah</li>
	<li>Dekonsentrasi pengelolaan pendidikan madrasah ke kantor Depag provinsi dan kabupaten yang kemudian mengontrak madrasah pendidikan dasar ke lembaga masyarakat</li>
	<li>Meningkatkan keadilan dana antara madrasah negeri dan swasta</li>

"27","1","Tertiary Education Teaching and Learning","<p dir=""ltr"">In order to provide high quality teaching, high-quality teachers are needed. The minimum educational level for higher education teachers are Master&rsquo;s degrees. The main aim&nbsp;in the planning of teaching should be relevance as well as balanced&nbsp;specialization and breadth.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">There must be a priority in improving <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=5"" target=""_blank"">teaching and learning</a>. More transversal skills like problem-solving and teamwork, as well as more innovative and entrepreneurial skills, are needed to develop critical reading and thinking skills. There is a need to emphasize students with more collaborative projects, teamwork&nbsp;and problem-based learning tasks</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Based on the <a href=""http://risbang.ristekdikti.go.id/regulasi/uu-12-2012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Higher Education Law</a>, each institution develops its own curriculum with reference to <a href=""http://jdih.ristekdikti.go.id/?q=perundangan/konten/11343"" target=""_blank"">National Higher Education Standards</a> for each study program. The management and lecturers need to have a clear focus on modernization of content and methods needs at the institutional level. The ministry must provide support and guidance about the teaching qualifications improvement at the central level. The curriculum needs to have a stronger <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=33"" target=""_blank"">link to society and industry</a>. Theoretical studies should be applied and supported with practical studies and orientation towards application.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Several incentives that can be used to encourage individual lecturers and institutions to develop new teaching skills are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Competitive funding schemes</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Teaching developments centers at institutions or group of institutions</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Stronger focus on the role of obligatory quality assurance unites at the institutions</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Career paths to be facilitated by successful research and by high-quality innovative teaching</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Increasing students&rsquo; roles in good teaching development and evaluation</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p dir=""ltr"">There should be more attention to the new teaching methods in both pre-service and in-service teacher education and training so teachers are introduced and used at school level. A well-functioned teaching/learning system depends on the flexibility and clear pathways and horizontal linkages that enable student mobility between programs and institutions. The <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=44"" target=""_blank"">National Qualifications Framework (NQF)</a> is the initiative taken by the government to reach this aim. In applying the NQF, the development of semester credit system to measure students&rsquo; workload and achievement is used. It is important that students are able to move across different education streams, academic, vocational, and professional, so there won&rsquo;t be any exaggeration in bridging arrangements between institutions and programs for the multi-entry, multi-exit education</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Internationalization of higher education is important to raise quality. Indonesia has been behind <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/"" target=""_blank"">OECD</a> averages and some of her Asian neighbors. There should be more emphasis on the internationalization of the curriculum, international benchmarking, international accreditation, joint programs, scholarship programs, etc. It is important for both students and staffs to participate in programs like the <a href=""http://www.aunsec.org/"" target=""_blank"">ASEAN University Network (AUN)</a> for mobility and quality assurance.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">It is hard to require tertiary education institution to be a research based with the large number of institutions and very limited resources. &nbsp;However, there is a need to raise the research and development (R&amp;D) budget. Research budget should be used in a more focused way, aiming to develop quality research and establish strong research programs, especially at the seven autonomous universities in the top tier, then on the second tier, public service universities, with additional criteria. &nbsp;Science, technology, engineering&nbsp;and agriculture should be the highest priority in research in order to support the goals of the <a href=""http://www.kemendag.go.id/files/pdf/2012/12/06/master-plan-2011-2025-id0-1354731495.pdf"" target=""_blank"">MP3EI master plan</a>.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">It is important for universities to be strong, particularly in the above disciplines, in order to play a decisive role in economic development. To attract funding, universities must able to enter into co-operative partnerships with business/industry. Universities should have more relations with the outside world, as well as build up expertise and supporting facilities needed for cooperation with business industries. Top tier universities could get benefit from the basic grant to do more fundamental research and act more independently to their external partners in business/industry and the national and international academic world. More and stronger PhD programs, especially in cooperation with business/industry, should be developed by the strongest universities with universal PhD coverage.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">There is an increase in research output and papers in international journals written by Indonesian researchers. The government and the universities should contribute together to develop expertise in taking out patents. There are many initiatives to support international networking and collaborative research projects, such as ASEAN research clusters, international PhD grants, and support for attending international seminars. A comprehensive international review of the Indonesian research system could give a boost to the system and be a great source of inspiration to policy makers, universities and researchers. It could also give guidance to what could be an ambitious and realistic national roadmap for research.</p>
","Belajar Mengajar pada tingkat Pendidikan Tinggi","<p>Dalam rangka memberikan pengajaran berkualitas,&nbsp; guru berkualitas diperlukan. Tingkat pendidikan minimum guru pendidikan tinggi adalah bergelar master. Tujuan utama perencanaan pengajaran harus relevan dan seimbang antara spesialisasi dan cakupannya.</p>

<p>Harus ada prioritas dalam meningkatkan pengajaran dan pembelajaran. Keterampilan transversal seperti pemecahan masalah dan kerja sama tim, keterampilan inovatif dan kewirausahaan, diperlukan untuk mengembangkan keterampilan membaca dan berpikir kritis. Siswa perlu diperkenalkan&nbsp; dengan kegiatan-kegiatan kolaboratif, kerja sama tim, dan tugas-tugas pembelajaran berbasis masalah</p>

<p>Berdasarkan Undang-Undang Pendidikan Tinggi, masing-masing lembaga mengembangkan kurikulum sendiri dengan mengacu pada Standar Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional untuk setiap program studi. Manajemen dan dosen harus memiliki fokus yang jelas pada pembaharuan konten dan metode di tingkat kelembagaan. Kementerian harus memberikan bantuan dan bimbingan dalam peningkatan kualifikasi mengajar di tingkat pusat. Kurikulum harus memiliki hubungan yang kuat dengan masyarakat dan dunia usaha. Pelajaran teoritis harus diberikan dan dibantu dengan pelajaran praktis dan berorientasi terhadap aplikasi.</p>

<p>Beberapa insentif yang dapat digunakan untuk mendorong dosen dan lembaga mengembangkan keterampilan mengajar baru diantaranya:</p>

<ul>
	<li>skema pendanaan yang kompetitif</li>
	<li>pusat pengembangan&nbsp; pengajaran di lembaga atau kelompok lembaga</li>
	<li>fokus lebih kuat pada peran lembaga jaminan mutu</li>
	<li>jalur karir difasilitasi oleh penelitian yang sukses dan dengan pengajaran inovatif berkualitas tinggi</li>
	<li>Meningkatkan peran siswa &nbsp;dalam pengembangan pengajaran dan evaluasi yang baik</li>
</ul>

<p>Perlu adanya metode pengajaran baru pada pendidikan dan pelatihan &nbsp;guru pra &ndash; jabatan dan dalam jabatan sehingga guru dapat memahami dan menerapkannya di tingkat sekolah. Sistem belajar mengajar yang berjalan baik tergantung pada jalur dan hubungan horizontal yang&nbsp; fleksibel dan jelas yang memungkinkan mobilitas siswa antara program dan lembaga. Kerangka Kualifikasi Nasional Indonesia (KKNI) merupakan inisiatif pemerintah untuk mencapai tujuan ini. Dalam menerapkan KKNI, pengembangan sistem kredit semester untuk mengukur beban dan prestasi siswa digunakan. Siswa harus masuk dalam berbagai sistem pendidikan, akademik, kejuruan, dan profesi, dapat menjembatani pengaturan antara lembaga dan program .</p>

<p>Internasionalisasi pendidikan tinggi merupakan hal yang penting untuk meningkatkan kualitas. Indonesia berada di belakang, dibandingkan dengan rata-rata OECD dan beberapa negara tetangganya di Asia. Harus ada penekanan lebih pada internasionalisasi kurikulum, benchmarking internasional, akreditasi internasional, program bersama, program beasiswa, dll.&nbsp; Hal ini penting bagi mahasiswa dan staf untuk berpartisipasi dalam program-program seperti Erasmus, ASEAN University Network (AUN) demi mobilitas dan jaminan kualitas.</p>

<p>Sulit untuk mengharapkan lembaga pendidikan tinggi menjadi pusat&nbsp; penelitian karena&nbsp; banyaknya jumlah lembaga dan keterbatasan&nbsp; sumber daya. Perlu ada&nbsp; peningkatan anggaran penelitian dan pengembangan (R &amp; D). Anggaran penelitian ini harus digunakan dengan lebih terfokus, ditujukan untuk mengembangkan kualitas penelitian dan membuat program penelitian yang kuat, terutama di tujuh universitas otonom tingkat atas, kemudian pada lapis kedua, universitas pelayanan publik, dengan kriteria tambahan. Sains, teknologi, teknik, dan pertanian harus menjadi prioritas penelitian untuk mendukung tujuan dari rencana induk MP3EI.</p>

<p>Perguruan tinggi harus kuat, terutama dalam disiplin ilmu di atas, dalam rangka untuk memainkan peran yang menentukan dalam pembangunan ekonomi. Untuk menarik dana, perguruan tinggi harus mampu menjalin kemitraan kerjasama dengan dunia usaha / industri. Perguruan tinggi harus mengembangkan pendekatan yang lebih baik berhubungan dengan dunia luar, serta membangun keahlian dan membantu fasilitas yang dibutuhkan untuk kerjasama dengan industri bisnis. Universitas-universitas papan atas bisa memanfaatkan hibah untuk melakukan penelitian dan lebih bebas berhubungan dengan mitra eksternal dalam bisnis / industri dan dunia akademis nasional dan internasional. Program PhD yang kuat, terutama dalam kerjasama dengan dunia usaha / industri, harus dikembangkan oleh universitas yang baik untuk mengembangkan &nbsp;cakupan PhD universal.</p>

<p>Ada peningkatan hasil penelitian dan makalah dalam jurnal internasional yang ditulis oleh peneliti Indonesia. Pemerintah dan perguruan tinggi harus membantu mengembangkan keahlian ini agar mendapatkan hak&nbsp; paten. Ada banyak upaya untuk mendukung jaringan internasional dan proyek-proyek penelitian kolaboratif, seperti penelitian ASEAN, hibah PhD internasional, dan bantuan untuk menghadiri seminar internasional. Sebuah tinjauan komprehensif internasional pada sistem penelitian Indonesia bisa mendorong sistem dan menjadi sumber inspirasi untuk para pembuat kebijakan, universitas dan peneliti. Tinjauan ini juga bisa menjadi acuan untuk &nbsp;penelitian roadmap nasional yang ambisius dan realistis.</p>

"28","1","Assessment","<p dir=""ltr"">Despite the many factors that can affect students&rsquo; performance, the way to identify how well a student does is through assessment. An assessment must have clear and realistic standards, which are guided by the curriculum and use the tools provided by the assessment system. In Indonesia, an issue that pertains to assessment includes the acknowledgment of real gap between student performance and mandated standards. Among others, this is due to the high number of cheating that occurs in national exams. Indonesia is also faced with regular changes in the education system. This does not allow for an up-to-date assessment system. Assessment standards needs to adjust with time and needs of relevant stakeholders. Uncertainty has led to lacks in implementing such standards. Furthermore, there is a bigger factor at play in Indonesia. Due to disparity of development and education, a continuing debate is whether standards should be set differently across the country.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Nevertheless, teachers still hold the key to identifying students&rsquo; skills and abilities. Teachers should be equipped with assessment literacy. There is also a need, as identified by Puspendik, to promote integrity in order to battle the habit of cheating during exams. The Ujian Nasional (UN) should also be maintained as the most reliable final assessment of students in grade 12. Streamlining it to focus on certain subjects can also be a useful strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Classroom Assessment</strong></p>

<p>Classroom assessment provides critical information to both the teacher and the student in order for learning to occur. The teacher needs to know in detail how students are responding to the teaching &ndash; whether the knowledge, skills and attitudes planned for in a particular lesson or unit of work are being acquired.</p>

<p>The Ministry currently has a plan to improve teaching and learning through the processes of certification and teacher competence testing linked to professional learning modules. If implemented well, these processes will contribute to improving classroom assessment but national training plans alone are not likely to be sufficient to drive improved teaching.</p>

<p>A desired direction would be that, through a combination of in-school, cluster group and district professional learning activities, all teachers will become more confident and skilled in employing a wide range of individual and group assessment techniques. This requires school leadership to be fully committed and engaged and a school climate that encourages sharing and peer learning. This must all be supported by access to good resources which include samples of students&rsquo; work and sample lesson plans with assessment embedded.</p>

<p>The quality and reach of current support for improving teaching and assessment is still problematic &ndash; cascade training, talking about or reading about how teachers can improve assessment has limited impact on behavior. Teachers need feedback and opportunities to reflect on their practice by being observed and guided by other practitioners. A school- based model of peer learning led by principals and senior teachers, with some external support from the cluster and district and online videos of good practice, would be an affordable approach and probably highly effective. Furthermore, it requires a deep understanding of the learning process to broaden the teacher mindset about in- class assessment to include a wider range of formal and informal activities to assess and support learning, including more individualized and informal interactions as they occur in the classroom; Principals also must become the pedagogical leaders of their schools. Their leadership will be critical for establishing high standards of teaching and assessment and fostering peer learning. Small schools in disadvantaged areas present additional challenges. Where the local support and opportunities to learn from others in the school are limited, visiting teachers and other education personnel with appropriate experience could fill the gap. This issue requires innovative thinking and resourcing models and can be accelerated when teachers have more ICT skills and infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>School Tests</strong></p>

<p>School tests fulfill the purposes of Assessment in the Decree 23/2016 to determine graduation from a unit, including progression from elementary to junior to senior secondary. The Decree on Assessment provides principles and broad guidance to schools. School tests have been a mandatory part of the education system for a very long time. However, from observations of the Puspendik team working with teachers, it seems that many teachers have little understanding of the basics of test construction, how to operationalize concepts such as validity, reliability and fairness and how to determine the level of difficulty of tests, to cater to the full range of students. There is a need for greater transparency in how marks are awarded and how to ensure that testing provides meaningful information to support learning.</p>

<p>There is a need to develop the &ldquo;assessment literacy&rdquo; of teachers and this should be part of being a good teacher. In the short term, collaboration across grades and across schools may help to spread good practice.</p>

<p>Up-skilling teachers to improve the quality of school tests, both the quantitative elements and the free response components, is an important issue. Puspendik has been assisting by providing 25 % of items to schools for inclusion in the tests at Grades 6 and 9. This provides a model which teachers can copy. Some teachers have participated in workshops conducted by Puspendik but more intensive support could be provided through locally-based agencies such as the LPMP. Improving assessment would be significantly accelerated if each LPMP had a small assessment unit, staffed by teachers and other experts in assessment, whose role was to promote the quality of all forms of school assessment, share good practices, conduct workshops and support principals in their role as pedagogical leaders. b. Promoting the importance of integrity in school tests and exams is an ongoing issue. Puspendik has been monitoring the extent of cheating on national exams and the rate is quite high in some areas. It is likely that the practice of individual or teacher assisted cheating on school exams might also be quite high in those areas, especially the marks from school tests contribute to placement decisions in the next Grade or next school. This is an issue which requires community support and cultural change in schools.</p>

<p><strong>National Exam (UN)</strong></p>

<p>The UN provides a key function for students and parents in recognizing student achievement at the end of key stages of schooling. In 2017 the situation is more complex than usual because of a moratorium announced in December 2016, its subsequent withdrawal and then the announcement of a new exam to be conducted in addition to the planned UN. It appears that the new exam (USBN) may be a response to assumptions that the UN is not sufficiently responsive to local culture and context. This is a similar argument to proposals for different standards in different provinces. The outcome would be that there would be no nationally comparable evidence by which to judge the academic outcomes of students, nor would there be nationally comparable data to indicate the real needs of schools in different parts of the country for additional resources to support learning.</p>

<p>Desirably, among others, in the short term, item writing and contextualizing of exam questions should be continuously improved through development of the item Blueprints involving both test design experts with regional representatives from LPMP and schools and MGMP. This can be efficiently conducted using ICT. The UN should also be maintained as the most reliable and valid Grade 12 student final assessment which provides information for a valued and prestigious National Exams Certificate which will become recognized as the major component of university entrance requirements. Collaborate with the higher education sector to develop a process for standardizing UN scores to provide a university entrance rank. CBT mode for the UN also needs to be maintained and enhanced. Improving the quality and variety of items in CBT format is also suggested. Ensure that disadvantaged schools not only have access to nearby computers but can provide students with facilitation and confidence in using CBT mode.</p>

<p>For 2017-2020 and the longer term, among others, more informed dialogue about UN is needed. Provide stakeholders with more information about the exams to reinforce that these are based on national standards and that the items are developed from materials and content ideas from teachers across many areas of Indonesia. This could include providing the Framework and samples of items to illustrate the point. There is also a need for increased and informed discussion on how to ensure equity &ndash; so that students from disadvantaged areas are able to access quality education and other options such as courses at Advanced level if these become available.</p>

","Penilaian","<p>Terlepas dari banyaknya faktor yang dapat mempengaruhi kinerja siswa, cara untuk mengidentifikasi seberapa baik seorang siswa adalah melalui penilaian. Penilaian harus memiliki standar yang jelas dan realistis, yang dipandu oleh kurikulum dan menggunakan alat yang disediakan oleh sistem penilaian. Di Indonesia, sebuah isu yang berkaitan dengan penilaian mencakup pengakuan akan kesenjangan nyata antara kinerja siswa dan standar yang dimandatkan. Antara lain, hal ini disebabkan tingginya jumlah kecurangan yang terjadi dalam ujian nasional. Indonesia juga dihadapkan pada perubahan sistem pendidikan secara reguler. Ini tidak memungkinkan untuk sistem penilaian yang up-to-date. Standar penilaian perlu disesuaikan dengan waktu dan kebutuhan pemangku kepentingan terkait. Ketidakpastian telah menyebabkan kurang menerapkan standar tersebut. Selain itu, ada faktor yang lebih besar bermain di Indonesia. Karena disparitas pembangunan dan pendidikan, perdebatan terus berlanjut adalah apakah standar harus ditetapkan secara berbeda di seluruh negeri.</p>

<p>Meskipun demikian, guru masih memegang kunci untuk mengidentifikasi kemampuan dan kemampuan siswa. Guru harus dilengkapi dengan penilaian melek huruf. Ada juga kebutuhan, seperti yang diidentifikasi oleh Puspendik, untuk mempromosikan integritas agar bisa melawan kebiasaan selingkuh selama ujian. Ujian Nasional (UN) juga harus dipertahankan sebagai penilaian akhir yang paling andal bagi siswa di kelas 12. Memperlancarnya untuk fokus pada mata pelajaran tertentu juga bisa menjadi strategi yang bermanfaat.</p>

<p><strong>Penilaian Kelas</strong></p>

<p>Penilaian kelas memberikan informasi penting kepada guru dan siswa agar pembelajaran dapat terjadi. Guru perlu mengetahui secara rinci bagaimana siswa menanggapi pengajaran - apakah pengetahuan, keterampilan dan sikap yang direncanakan dalam pelajaran atau unit kerja tertentu sedang diperoleh.</p>

<p>Kementerian saat ini memiliki rencana untuk memperbaiki pengajaran dan pembelajaran melalui proses sertifikasi dan uji kompetensi guru yang terkait dengan modul pembelajaran profesional. Jika diimplementasikan dengan baik, proses ini akan berkontribusi untuk memperbaiki penilaian kelas namun rencana pelatihan nasional saja tidak mungkin cukup untuk mendorong pengajaran yang lebih baik.</p>

<p>Arah yang dikehendaki adalah, melalui kombinasi antara kegiatan pembelajaran profesional di sekolah, kelompok cluster dan distrik, semua guru akan menjadi lebih percaya diri dan ahli dalam menggunakan berbagai teknik penilaian individu dan kelompok. Hal ini membutuhkan kepemimpinan sekolah untuk berkomitmen penuh dan terlibat dan iklim sekolah yang mendorong berbagi dan pembelajaran sebaya. Ini semua harus didukung oleh akses terhadap sumber daya yang baik termasuk contoh karya siswa dan contoh rencana pelajaran dengan penilaian yang disematkan.</p>

<p>Kualitas dan jangkauan dukungan terkini untuk memperbaiki pengajaran dan penilaian masih bermasalah - pelatihan kaskade, berbicara tentang atau membaca tentang bagaimana guru dapat memperbaiki penilaian memiliki dampak terbatas pada perilaku. Guru membutuhkan umpan balik dan kesempatan untuk merenungkan praktik mereka dengan diamati dan dipandu oleh praktisi lain. Model pembelajaran peer yang berbasis sekolah yang dipimpin oleh kepala sekolah dan guru senior, dengan beberapa dukungan eksternal dari cluster dan distrik dan video praktik terbaik online, akan menjadi pendekatan yang terjangkau dan mungkin sangat efektif. Selanjutnya, diperlukan pemahaman mendalam tentang proses pembelajaran untuk memperluas pola pikir guru tentang penilaian di kelas untuk memasukkan berbagai kegiatan formal dan informal yang lebih luas untuk menilai dan mendukung pembelajaran, termasuk interaksi yang lebih individual dan informal saat terjadi di kelas; Kepala sekolah juga harus menjadi pemimpin pedagogis di sekolah mereka. Kepemimpinan mereka sangat penting untuk menetapkan standar pengajaran dan penilaian yang tinggi dan mendorong pembelajaran sebaya. Sekolah-sekolah kecil di daerah tertinggal menghadirkan tantangan tambahan. Bila dukungan dan kesempatan lokal untuk belajar dari orang lain di sekolah terbatas, guru pengajar dan tenaga kependidikan lainnya dengan pengalaman yang sesuai dapat mengisi kesenjangan. Isu ini memerlukan pemikiran inovatif dan model sumber daya dan dapat dipercepat ketika para guru memiliki lebih banyak keterampilan dan infrastruktur TIK.</p>

<p><strong>Tes Sekolah</strong></p>

<p>Tes sekolah memenuhi tujuan Penilaian dalam Keputusan 23/2016 untuk menentukan kelulusan dari satu unit, termasuk perkembangan dari SD sampai SMP ke SMA. Keputusan tentang Penilaian memberikan prinsip dan panduan yang luas kepada sekolah. Tes sekolah telah menjadi bagian wajib dari sistem pendidikan untuk waktu yang sangat lama. Namun, dari pengamatan tim Puspendik yang bekerja dengan guru, nampaknya banyak guru memiliki sedikit pemahaman tentang dasar-dasar konstruksi uji, bagaimana mengoperasionalkan konsep seperti validitas, reliabilitas dan kewajaran dan bagaimana menentukan tingkat kesulitan tes, untuk Melayani berbagai siswa. Ada kebutuhan untuk transparansi yang lebih besar mengenai bagaimana tanda diberikan dan bagaimana memastikan bahwa pengujian memberikan informasi yang berarti untuk mendukung pembelajaran.</p>

<p>Ada kebutuhan untuk mengembangkan &quot;penilaian keaksaraan&quot; guru dan ini harus menjadi guru yang baik. Dalam jangka pendek, kolaborasi antar kelas dan lintas sekolah dapat membantu menyebarkan praktik yang baik.</p>

<p>Guru up-skilling untuk meningkatkan kualitas tes sekolah, elemen kuantitatif dan komponen tanggapan bebas, merupakan isu penting. Puspendik telah membantu dengan menyediakan 25% item ke sekolah untuk dimasukkan dalam tes di Kelas 6 dan 9. Ini memberikan model yang dapat disalin oleh guru. Beberapa guru telah berpartisipasi dalam lokakarya yang dilakukan oleh Puspendik namun dukungan lebih intensif dapat diberikan melalui lembaga berbasis lokal seperti LPMP. Penilaian perbaikan akan dipercepat secara signifikan jika masing-masing LPMP memiliki unit penilaian kecil, yang dikelola oleh guru dan ahli lainnya dalam penilaian, yang perannya mempromosikan kualitas semua bentuk penilaian sekolah, berbagi praktik yang baik, melakukan lokakarya dan mendukung kepala sekolah dalam peran mereka. Sebagai pemimpin pedagogis. B. Mempromosikan pentingnya integritas dalam ujian dan ujian sekolah merupakan isu yang terus berlanjut. Puspendik telah memantau sejauh mana kecurangan dalam ujian nasional dan tingkatnya cukup tinggi di beberapa daerah. Kemungkinan praktik kecurangan individu atau guru dalam ujian sekolah mungkin juga cukup tinggi di area tersebut, terutama tanda dari tes sekolah yang berkontribusi terhadap keputusan penempatan di kelas berikutnya atau di sekolah berikutnya. Ini adalah isu yang membutuhkan dukungan masyarakat dan perubahan budaya di sekolah.</p>

<p><strong>Ujian Nasional (UN)</strong></p>

<p>UN memberikan fungsi kunci bagi siswa dan orang tua dalam mengenali prestasi belajar siswa di akhir tahap kunci sekolah. Pada 2017 situasinya lebih kompleks dari biasanya karena adanya moratorium yang diumumkan pada bulan Desember 2016, penarikan selanjutnya dan kemudian pengumuman sebuah ujian baru akan dilakukan disamping rencana UN. Tampaknya ujian baru (USBN) mungkin merupakan respons terhadap asumsi bahwa PBB tidak cukup responsif terhadap budaya dan konteks lokal. Ini adalah argumen yang serupa dengan proposal untuk standar yang berbeda di berbagai provinsi. Hasilnya adalah bahwa tidak akan ada bukti yang dapat dibandingkan secara nasional untuk menilai hasil akademik siswa, dan juga tidak ada data yang dapat dibandingkan secara nasional untuk menunjukkan kebutuhan nyata sekolah di berbagai belahan negara untuk mendapatkan sumber daya tambahan untuk mendukung pembelajaran.</p>

<p>Diharapkan antara lain dalam jangka pendek, penulisan item dan kontekstualisasi soal ujian harus terus ditingkatkan melalui pengembangan cetak biru item yang melibatkan pakar desain uji baik dengan perwakilan daerah dari LPMP dan sekolah dan MGMP. Hal ini dapat dilakukan secara efisien dengan menggunakan ICT. PBB juga harus dipelihara sebagai penilaian akhir siswa kelas 12 yang paling dapat diandalkan dan valid yang memberikan informasi untuk Sertifikat Ujian Nasional yang bernilai dan bergengsi yang akan diakui sebagai komponen utama persyaratan masuk universitas. Berkolaborasi dengan sektor pendidikan tinggi untuk mengembangkan proses standarisasi skor UN untuk memberikan peringkat masuk universitas. Modus CBT untuk PBB juga perlu dipelihara dan ditingkatkan. Meningkatkan kualitas dan variasi item dalam format CBT juga disarankan. Pastikan bahwa sekolah yang kurang beruntung tidak hanya memiliki akses ke komputer terdekat namun dapat memberi para siswa fasilitasi dan kepercayaan diri dalam menggunakan mode CBT.</p>

<p>Untuk tahun 2017-2020 dan jangka panjang, antara lain, diperlukan dialog informasi mengenai UN. Berikan lebih banyak informasi kepada para pemangku kepentingan untuk memastikan bahwa ini didasarkan pada standar nasional dan item dikembangkan dari bahan dan gagasan konten dari guru di banyak wilayah di Indonesia. Ini bisa termasuk menyediakan Kerangka dan contoh item untuk menggambarkan intinya. Ada juga kebutuhan untuk diskusi yang meningkat dan diinformasikan tentang bagaimana memastikan keadilan - sehingga siswa dari daerah tertinggal dapat mengakses pendidikan berkualitas dan pilihan lain seperti kursus di tingkat Lanjutan jika tersedia.</p>

"29","1","Curriculum and Textbooks","<p dir=""ltr"">Indonesia is in a difficult situation because the MoEC created a curriculum in 2013, K13, but have encountered difficulties implementing it due in part to a fragmented curriculum assembled by different people and groups without coordination among them or alignment of basic principles. For example, the people who wrote the national textbooks had little or no teaching experience in K-12 and little training in the core concepts of the new curriculum. A second problem is the sheer volume of information to be taught in an overburdened curriculum and the unrealistic goals of what teachers can accomplish. A third problem is the lack of training that teachers received to implement the new curriculum. The MoEC began implementation with teachers in grades 4 and 7 and expected schools to train teachers at other grade levels, but resources, information, trained leaders, and incentives were missing so training in K13 was uneven at best across schools and provinces. It is worth noting that Indonesia is large and diverse, and, as may be expected, educational training, along with materials and innovation, are less available in rural provinces where language, poverty, and attendance are often more problematic than the curriculum.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The challenges faced by Indonesia are similar to the Philippines where multiple languages and remote islands make centralized educational policies difficult. In contrast, curriculum reform in Singapore, South Korea, and Japan are relatively easier because of fewer people, fewer languages, higher standards of living, more trained teachers, and more uniformity among citizens within the countries. These three countries are all high-achieving by international educational standards such as the PISA and TIMSS, and they are all shaped by centralized educational policies, testing, and teacher training so comparisons to Indonesia may not be inappropriate. Yet, educational policymakers and national leaders are often led to make regional comparisons about educational achievement because it affects the qualifications of the labor force and ultimately the economic prospects of the country.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Thus, the pressures for educational reforms and success might be similar among countries in Asia where economic engines drive the development of national labor forces, but the challenges, risks, and opportunities vary widely among countries in the region. Indonesia must solve its unique problems within the contexts that history, religion, and culture have provided. This means that Indonesian national identity, defined in part by the tenets of Pancasila, will guide an educational system more concerned with character development and citizenship than academic achievement alone. The ways that K13 will be implemented, and eventually revised and replaced, must be carefully chosen to accommodate a diverse nation yet lead to enhanced quality of learning and teaching so that citizens are prepared for the 21st century.</p>

<p>Curriculum 2013 has been introduced without sufficient time or available mechanisms for trialing, feedback, review and improvement. It is also a centralized curriculum development without formal structures to allow input and feedback from teachers and principals in schools. Furthermore, student textbooks tend to be over ambitious in the content that can be covered and the time required by teachers to implement them in classrooms does not seem to have been taken into account.</p>

<p>Some options are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Establishing and fostering communities of practice at school and district levels;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Reviewing all curriculum, textbooks and associated materials, to ensure they are suitable for use before being disseminated, particularly the alignment of an effective and engaging instructional approach in each subject by comparing the curriculum, teacher guides and textbooks with those of other countries (e.g. countries in the ASEAN region and selected OECD);</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Correcting all textbooks and other materials that have factual mistakes, or are currently inappropriate;</p>

<p>Commitment to Environmental Education (EE) varies between sector ministries and regional government agencies. National policies are ineffectively linked with provincial, district and city policies and plans. School supervisors, principals and teachers lack capacity required to integrate EE into curriculum and pedagogy. Teachers lack access to EE materials and resources, especially those that are locally contextualized. National and regional networking platforms and forums to support teachers in integrating EE are lacking as is a method for leveraging existing capacity and expertise.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Improving overall capacity and technical guidance provided to school supervisors, principals and teachers by developing a curriculum for training teachers and an implementing handbook for schools. The handbook will cover concepts and skills needed to implement EE in schools.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Strengthening support provided for teachers specifically in regards to integrating EE into curriculum by developing a technical guidance manual with student centred pedagogical methods.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Strengthening national ministerial and regional government commitments to support EE in schools. One way of doing this is by creating a National Working Group for EE.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Inventorying and cataloguing existing EE related materials and resources and building an online portal that teachers can easily access while building a forum for teachers to network and exchange information, experiences and good practice.</p>

","Kurikulum dan Buku Teks","<p>Indonesia berada dalam situasi yang sulit karena MoEC menciptakan sebuah kurikulum pada tahun 2013, K13, namun mengalami kesulitan menerapkannya karena sebagian dari kurikulum terfragmentasi yang dikumpulkan oleh orang dan kelompok yang berbeda tanpa koordinasi di antara mereka atau penyelarasan prinsip-prinsip dasar. Misalnya, orang-orang yang menulis buku teks nasional hanya memiliki sedikit pengalaman mengajar di K-12 dan sedikit pelatihan dalam konsep inti kurikulum baru. Masalah kedua adalah banyaknya informasi yang harus diajarkan dalam kurikulum yang tidak terbebani dan tujuan yang tidak realistis dari apa yang dapat dicapai oleh guru. Masalah ketiga adalah kurangnya pelatihan yang diterima guru untuk menerapkan kurikulum baru. MoEC mulai diimplementasikan dengan para guru di kelas 4 dan 7 dan mengharapkan sekolah untuk melatih guru di tingkat kelas yang lain, namun sumber daya, informasi, pemimpin terlatih, dan insentif hilang sehingga pelatihan di K13 tidak merata di sekolah dan provinsi. Perlu dicatat bahwa Indonesia itu besar dan beragam, dan seperti yang diharapkan, pelatihan pendidikan, bersama dengan materi dan inovasi, kurang tersedia di provinsi pedesaan dimana bahasa, kemiskinan, dan kehadiran seringkali lebih bermasalah daripada kurikulum.</p>

<p>Tantangan yang dihadapi Indonesia sama dengan Filipina di mana banyak bahasa dan pulau terpencil membuat kebijakan pendidikan terpusat menjadi sulit. Sebaliknya, reformasi kurikulum di Singapura, Korea Selatan, dan Jepang relatif lebih mudah karena lebih sedikit orang, bahasa yang lebih sedikit, standar hidup yang lebih tinggi, guru yang lebih terlatih, dan keseragaman yang lebih banyak di antara warga negara di negara-negara tersebut. Ketiga negara ini semua berprestasi tinggi dengan standar pendidikan internasional seperti PISA dan TIMSS, dan semuanya dibentuk oleh kebijakan pendidikan, pengujian, dan pelatihan pendidikan terpusat sehingga perbandingan ke Indonesia mungkin tidak sesuai. Namun, para pembuat kebijakan pendidikan dan pemimpin nasional sering kali diarahkan untuk membuat perbandingan regional mengenai prestasi pendidikan karena hal itu mempengaruhi kualifikasi angkatan kerja dan pada akhirnya prospek ekonomi negara tersebut.</p>

<p>Dengan demikian, tekanan untuk reformasi pendidikan dan keberhasilan mungkin serupa di antara negara-negara di Asia di mana mesin ekonomi mendorong pengembangan angkatan kerja nasional, namun tantangan, risiko, dan peluang sangat bervariasi di antara negara-negara di kawasan ini. Indonesia harus memecahkan masalah uniknya dalam konteks yang telah diberikan oleh sejarah, agama, dan budaya. Ini berarti bahwa identitas nasional Indonesia, yang sebagian didefinisikan oleh prinsip-prinsip Pancasila, akan membimbing sebuah sistem pendidikan yang lebih memperhatikan pengembangan karakter dan kewarganegaraan daripada prestasi akademik semata. Cara K13 akan dilaksanakan, dan akhirnya direvisi dan diganti, harus dipilih dengan hati-hati untuk mengakomodasi beragam bangsa namun mengarah pada peningkatan kualitas pembelajaran dan pengajaran sehingga warga dipersiapkan untuk abad ke-21.</p>

<p>Kurikulum 2013 telah diperkenalkan tanpa cukup waktu atau mekanisme yang tersedia untuk uji coba, umpan balik, review dan perbaikan. Ini juga merupakan pengembangan kurikulum terpusat tanpa struktur formal untuk memungkinkan masukan dan umpan balik dari guru dan kepala sekolah di sekolah. Selanjutnya, buku teks siswa cenderung terlalu ambisius dalam konten yang dapat ditutupi dan waktu yang dibutuhkan oleh guru untuk menerapkannya di kelas tampaknya tidak diperhitungkan.</p>

	<li>Memperbaiki semua buku teks dan materi lainnya yang memiliki kesalahan faktual, atau saat ini tidak sesuai;</li>
	<li>Mempertimbangkan kembali struktur pelatihan saat ini untuk bergerak melampaui &#39;sosialisasi&#39;;</li>

<p>Komitmen terhadap Pendidikan Lingkungan (EE) bervariasi antara kementerian sektoral dan instansi pemerintah daerah. Kebijakan nasional tidak terkait secara efektif dengan kebijakan dan rencana provinsi, kabupaten dan kota. Pengawas, kepala sekolah, dan guru di sekolah tidak memiliki kapasitas yang dibutuhkan untuk mengintegrasikan EE ke dalam kurikulum dan pedagogi. Guru kekurangan akses terhadap materi dan sumber EE, terutama yang secara lokal diekstrualisasikan. Platform jejaring dan forum nasional dan regional untuk mendukung guru dalam mengintegrasikan EE kurang seperti metode untuk memanfaatkan kapasitas dan keahlian yang ada.</p>

<p>Meningkatkan kapasitas dan bimbingan teknis secara keseluruhan yang diberikan kepada pengawas, kepala sekolah, dan guru di sekolah dengan mengembangkan kurikulum untuk melatih guru dan buku pedoman pelaksanaan untuk sekolah. Buku pegangan ini akan mencakup konsep dan keterampilan yang dibutuhkan untuk menerapkan EE di sekolah.</p>

<p>Memperkuat dukungan yang diberikan kepada guru secara khusus dalam hal mengintegrasikan EE ke dalam kurikulum dengan mengembangkan manual panduan teknis dengan metode pedagogis terpusat pada siswa.</p>

<p>Memperkuat komitmen pemerintah pusat dan daerah untuk mendukung EE di sekolah. Salah satu cara untuk melakukannya adalah dengan menciptakan Kelompok Kerja Nasional untuk EE.</p>

<p>Inventarisasi dan katalogkan bahan dan sumber terkait EE yang ada dan membangun portal online sehingga guru dapat dengan mudah mengakses sambil membangun sebuah forum bagi para guru untuk jaringan dan bertukar informasi, pengalaman dan praktik yang baik.</p>

"31","1","Postsecondary Education","<p dir=""ltr"">Postsecondary education, also known as&nbsp;tertiary or higher education institutions (HEIs), can be divided into five distinct types, according to <a href=""http://kelembagaan.ristekdikti.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/UU_no_20_th_2003.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Education Law 20/2003</a> and <a href=""http://risbang.ristekdikti.go.id/regulasi/uu-12-2012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Higher Education Law 12/2012</a>:</p>

<ol>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Academies (Akademi) and Community Colleges (Akademi Komunitas), which offer only one or a limited number of fields of study;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Polytechnics (Politeknik), which offer vocational education or practical skills development;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Advanced Schools (Sekolah Tinggi), which provide academic and vocational education in one specific discipline;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Institutes (Institut), consisting of several faculties or departments pertaining to one particular discipline; and</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Universities (Universitas), which off er academic study across multiple disciplines and professional education.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p dir=""ltr"">There are more than 3,600 higher education institutes serving 5.4 million students in Indonesia. In 2014, postsecondary education in Indonesia was relocated from the authority of MoEC to MoRA. Unlike pre-tertiary education, higher education in Indonesia is directly managed by the central government. MoRA, through the Directorate General for Higher Education (DGHE), is responsible for managing public and private higher education institutions. In addition, several government ministries and agencies administer 82 higher education service institutes (PTN Khusus) to ensure a supply of human resources for their respective ministries.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In terms of regulations, <a href=""http://risbang.ristekdikti.go.id/regulasi/uu-12-2012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Higher Education Law 12/2012</a> encapsulates higher education regulations in Indonesia today. Level, For instance, it rules that regardless of their race, faith, age, and physical background, all Indonesian citizens have the right to pursue higher education. It also presents three types of higher education: vocational, academic, and specialist or professional. Students who have graduated from one type of higher education can continue their studies at another. The degrees awarded by HEIs under the current system are Diploma (Ahli Pratama, Ahli Muda&nbsp;and Ahli Madya), Bachelor (Sarjana), Master/Professional (Magister)&nbsp;and Doctor/Specialist (Doktor). The functions of higher education are summarized under the term Tridharma (three &lsquo;dharmas&rsquo;): teaching, research, and community service.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The central government is responsible for developing at least one public university in each province and, together with regional governments, is responsible for developing at least one academy at district level. The central government is also responsible for establishing &lsquo;flagship universities&rsquo; (perguruan tinggi unggulan) at national level, which excel in one particular field of science, technology, or the arts. The central government also facilitates relationships among higher education institutions, industry, and regional governments. In terms of quality assurance, it is undertaken internally by the universities themselves and externally by <a href=""https://banpt.or.id/"" target=""_blank"">BAN-PT</a>. All higher education institutions have to pass an accreditation process conducted by BAN-PT. Failure to pass the process will lead to administrative sanctions, and the institution&rsquo;s license may be revoked. In addition to BAN-PT, the law indicates that an independent accreditation body&nbsp;can be set up by the government and the public to ensure public accountability of HEIs.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In terms of financing, central government funding for higher education is allocated for:</p>

<ol>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Public HEIs as a subsidy to cover operational costs, lecturer and personnel salaries, investment and development;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Private HEIs in the form of professional allowances for lecturers and professors, and funds for investment and development;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Public and private HEIs in the form of research funding; the law specifies that at least 30% of the government&rsquo;s higher education budget shall be allocated for research. This is to address the low capacity of research and innovation produced by Indonesian HEIs;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Students in the form of scholarships.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to central government funding, public HEIs are allowed to generate additional income from students and through contracts from regional governments and industry. Public HEIs must provide scholarships to at least 20% of their total student enrollment. Private higher education sector, private higher education institutions may obtain investment or operational funds from central and regional governments, and civil servant lecturers can be assigned to teach at private higher education institutions.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Last but not least, according to the law, Indonesian HEIs can develop international partnerships through cross-border programs, research, and community services. Foreign universities are allowed to provide higher education in Indonesia provided that they are set up under a not-for-profi t legal entity (such as a foundation or yayasan), they partner with a local university, and they employ local lecturers. However, the law does not specify how foreign qualifications should be recognized in Indonesia.</p>

<p><a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=27"" target=""_blank""><u>Education Financing</u></a></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>An important issue in Indonesian higher education fi nancing is the relatively small budget assigned for research and development.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Household spending on higher education goes mainly toward tuition and living expenses. On average, sending one child to university can cost an Indonesian family between Rp 10.6 million (US$ 1,200) and Rp 19.4 million (US$ 2,200), or up to a third of annual household income (see Figure 29 below), a share likely to be much higher for families from the poorest quintiles.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The government&rsquo;s scholarships do not significantly reduce the gap in enrollment between the richest and poorest quintiles. Reasons for this may be that government scholarship schemes are mainly targeted at students already enrolled in the system and that there is limited funding available for scholarships.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Enrollment, Participation&nbsp;and Equity</u></p>

<p>Indonesia&rsquo;s higher education landscape is characterized by a growth in provision by private institutions. Of the 3,794 total higher education institutions, 96.3% are private. However, although public institutions represent only 3.7% of the total, they account for 38.3% of enrollments.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>When compared to other countries in ASEAN, Indonesia&rsquo;s Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) for higher education is relatively low. Only 27.10% of young people in the 19-23 age group were enrolled in higher education in Indonesia in 2010, which is half of Thailand&rsquo;s GER.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Generally Java, particularly Jakarta and Jogjakarta, is perceived to offer better quality higher education, which leads to a very high transition rate in those two provinces. Parents from other provinces often choose to send their children to these two cities despite the additional living costs that they have to bear.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It is clear that there is a very wide gap in enrollment rates between the richest 20% and the other four quintile groupings.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Gender inequality increases as students move up through the various levels of HE, although there are variations between public and private institutions. Female students comprise the majority at the diploma level (S0) in most institutions (except in private faith-based institutions). However, the ratio of females to males tends to fall at each level above that. By the time the highest level is reached &ndash; PhD or S3 &ndash; women constitute between 17% (in faith-based public institutions) and 36% (in general public institutions) of total enrollments. The reasons for this drop deserve further study, and may include social attitudes, and economic and family related factors.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>As was mentioned previously, public institutions under MoEC, which account for about 6% of the total number of HE institutions in the country, are responsible for about 47% of total HE enrollments. With the exception of a few large private institutions such as Bina Nusantara University, Trisakti University&nbsp;and Gunadarma University, most private institutions tend to be much smaller. A small private HEI without a government subsidy depends largely on students&rsquo; tuition and other fees to meet the costs of all education-related activities. With a very small budget, it is doubtful whether the institution would be able to attract lecturers of good quality and provide adequate teaching and learning support.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Quality</strong></p>

<p><u>Personnel</u></p>

<p>Only about 38% of lecturers have master&rsquo;s degrees, doctorate degrees&nbsp;or specialist degrees at the master or doctorate level.</p>

<p><u>Accreditation</u></p>

<p>According to the 2012 BAN-PT report, the overall quality of many HEIs in Indonesia is still low. Including all programs off ered in public and private HEIs, there are a total of 14,489 higher education study programs off ered to students throughout Indonesia, with public institutions leading the way in terms of quality (with the exception of a few well-established private universities). A signifi cant proportion (20.5%) of the total number of study programs has not yet been accredited, due to the limited number of assessors and the large number of the study programs that need to be assessed; more than half of these (67%) are private.</p>

<p>At the diploma level, 67.6% of the study programs provided by public HEIs have been accredited at either A or B level, compared with just 31.1% of the programs provided by private HEIs. Similarly, at the S1 level, 77.2% of the public HEI study programs have an A or B accreditation, compared with only 39.9% of private HEI study programs. At the S2&ndash;S3 level, the difference between public and private HEIs is more pronounced. At this level, 40.6% of the programs provided by public HEIs have an A accreditation, compared with only 6.4% for the programs provided by private HEIs.</p>

<p>Options include, but are not limited to (sourced from OECD/ADB, 2015, see references below):</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The government adopting a differentiated approach to the development of tertiary education. The base of the system should be broadened to accommodate a greater proportion of those leaving senior school cost effectively. Expansion should mainly be via teaching-oriented institutions with different but well-defined profiles and missions, providing society and the labour market with relevant knowledge and skills, and should support the goals of social inclusion and geographical equity. The expansion of community colleges and polytechnics is a promising step in this direction. The top of the system should comprise a small number of high-quality, internationally reputable research-based universities which can act as engines for the development of Indonesian society, the economy and the higher education sector. In the middle should be a range of institutions variously engaged with their local communities, and business-facing in the production of graduates and the application of knowledge, know-how and technology.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The Ministry for Research and Technology and Higher Education conducting a review of the optimum scale of tertiary education providers on a district basis, taking into account the breadth, depth and quality of programme offerings, with a view to establishing minimum benchmarks for institutional accreditation. It should then consider offering incentives for buy-outs and mergers, and public-private partnerships to tackle the weakest institutions. It should continue the moratorium on the establishment of new private higher education institutions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The government urgently expanding the accreditation capacity of the National Board for Accreditation of Higher Education (BAN-PT), and ensure that sector-specific accreditation for professional fields (LAM-PT) is established effectively.</p>
	</li>

","Pendidikan Tinggi","<p>Pendidikan postsecondary, juga dikenal sebagai pendidikan tinggi atau tersier, dapat dibagi menjadi lima jenis yang berbeda, menurut UU Pendidikan Nomor&nbsp; 20/2003 dan UU Pendidikan Tinggi Nomor 12/2012:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Akademi dan Akademi Komunitas, yang hanya menawarkan satu atau sejumlah bidang studi terbatas;</li>
	<li>Politeknik, yang menawarkan pendidikan kejuruan atau pengembangan keterampilan praktis; &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Sekolah Tinggi, yang menyediakan pendidikan akademik dan kejuruan dalam satu disiplin tertentu;</li>
	<li>Institut, terdiri dari beberapa fakultas atau departemen yang berkaitan dengan salah satu disiplin tertentu; dan</li>
	<li>Universitas, yang menawarkan studi akademis di berbagai disiplin ilmu dan pendidikan profesional.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ada lebih dari 3.600 lembaga pendidikan tinggi yang melayani 5,4 juta siswa di Indonesia. Pada tahun 2014, pendidikan postsecondary di Indonesia dipindahkan dari kewenangan Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan ke Kementerian Agama. Tidak seperti pendidikan pra-perguruan tinggi, pendidikan tinggi di Indonesia dikelola langsung oleh pemerintah pusat. Kemenag, melalui Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi (Ditjen Dikti), bertanggung jawab untuk mengelola lembaga pendidikan tinggi negeri dan swasta. Selain itu, beberapa kementerian dan lembaga pemerintah mengelola 82 lembaga layanan pendidikan yang lebih tinggi (PTN Khusus) untuk menjamin ketersediaan sumber daya manusia untuk kementerian masing-masing.</p>

<p>Dalam hal peraturan, UU Perguruan Tinggi 12/2012 merangkum peraturan pendidikan tinggi di Indonesia saat ini. Misalnya, terlepas dari ras, keyakinan, usia, dan latar belakang fisik mereka, semua warga negara Indonesia memiliki hak untuk melanjutkan pendidikan tinggi. UU ini juga mengungkapkan ada tiga jenis pendidikan tinggi: kejuruan, akademik, dan spesialis atau profesi. Siswa yang telah lulus dari satu jenis pendidikan tinggi dapat melanjutkan studi mereka di yang lain. Gelar yang diberikan oleh PT di bawah sistem sekarang ialah Diploma (Ahli Pratama, Ahli Muda, dan Ahli Madya), Sarjana, Master / Profesi (Magister), dan Doktor / Spesialis. Fungsi pendidikan tinggi terangkum dalam istilah Tridharma: pengajaran, penelitian, dan pengabdian masyarakat.</p>

<p>Pemerintah pusat bertanggung jawab untuk mengembangkan setidaknya satu universitas negeri di setiap provinsi dan, bersama-sama dengan pemerintah daerah, bertanggung jawab untuk mengembangkan setidaknya satu akademi di tingkat kabupaten. Pemerintah pusat juga bertanggung jawab untuk membangun &#39; flagship universitas &#39; ( Perguruan Tinggi Unggulan) di tingkat nasional, yang unggul dalam satu bidang tertentu sains, teknologi, atau seni. Pemerintah pusat juga memfasilitasi hubungan antar lembaga pendidikan tinggi, industri, dan pemerintah daerah. Penjaminan mutu dilakukan secara internal oleh perguruan tinggi sendiri dan secara eksternal oleh BAN - PT. Semua institusi pendidikan tinggi harus lulus akreditasi yang dilakukan oleh BAN - PT. Kalau tidak lulus maka akan mendapatkan sanksi administrasi, dan lisensi lembaga dapat dicabut. Selain BAN - PT, UU juga menunjukkan bahwa Lembaga Akreditasi Mandir) dapat diminta oleh pemerintah dan masyarakat untuk menjamin akuntabilitas publik PT.</p>

<p>Dalam hal pembiayaan, dana pemerintah pusat untuk pendidikan tinggi dialokasikan untuk:</p>

<ol>
	<li>PTN sebagai subsidi untuk menutupi biaya operasional, gaji dosen dan tenaga kependidikan, investasi dan pengembangan;</li>
	<li>PTS dalam bentuk tunjangan profesi untuk dosen dan profesor, dan dana untuk investasi dan pengembangan;</li>
	<li>PTN dan PTS &nbsp;dalam bentuk dana penelitian; UU menetapkan bahwa setidaknya 30% anggaran pemerintah untuk &nbsp;pendidikan tinggi dialokasikan untuk penelitian. Hal ini untuk mengatasi rendahnya kapasitas penelitian dan inovasi yang dihasilkan oleh PT di Indonesia;</li>
	<li>Siswa dalam bentuk beasiswa.</li>
</ol>

<p>Selain dana dari pemerintah pusat, PTN diperbolehkan untuk menerima pemasukan tambahan dari siswa dan dari kontrak dengan pemerintah daerah dan industri. PTN harus memberikan beasiswa kepada setidaknya 20 persen dari total pendaftaran siswa mereka. Sektor pendidikan tinggi swasta, lembaga pendidikan tinggi swasta dapat menerima investasi atau dana operasional dari pemerintah pusat dan daerah, dan dosen PNS dapat ditugaskan untuk mengajar di lembaga pendidikan tinggi swasta.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">Terakhir, menurut UU, PT di Indonesia dapat mengembangkan kemitraan internasional melalui program lintas-perbatasan, penelitian, dan pengabdian masyarakat. Universitas asing diperbolehkan untuk menyelenggarakan pendidikan tinggi di Indonesia asalkan berbentuk &nbsp;badan hokum non-profit (seperti yayasan), bermitra dengan universitas lokal, dan mempekerjakan dosen lokal. Namun, UU tidak menentukan kualifikasi asing yang diakui di Indonesia. Sebuah studi pada tahun 2011 menemukan bahwa pengakuan kualifikasi asing adalah salah satu masalah utama yang dihadapi baik oleh universitas asing yang ingin masuk ke Indonesia maupun oleh perguruan tinggi di Indonesia yang ingin mengembangkan program lintas batas, seperti pembelajaran <em>twinning</em> dan pembelajaran jarak jauh.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Pembiayaan Pendidikan</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Masalah &nbsp;yang penting dalam pembiayaan pendidikan tinggi Indonesia adalah anggaran yang relatif kecil untuk penelitian dan pengembangan.</li>
	<li>pengeluaran rumah tangga pada pendidikan tinggi diperuntukan pada biaya kuliah dan biaya hidup. Rata-rata, untuk menyekolahkan satu anak ke universitas perlu biaya antara Rp 10,6 juta (US $ 1.200) dan Rp 19,4 juta (US $ 2.200), atau sampai sepertiga dari pendapatan tahunan keluarga (lihat Gambar 29 di bawah ini), mungkin jauh lebih tinggi bagi keluarga dari kuintil termiskin.</li>
	<li>Beasiswa&nbsp; Pemerintah tidak signifikan mengurangi kesenjangan pendaftaran antara kuintil terkaya dan termiskin. Penyebanya adalah bahwa skema beasiswa pemerintah dikhususkan untuk siswa yang sudah terdaftar di sistem dan juga ketersediaan dana beasiswa yang terbatas.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pendaftaran, Partisipasi&nbsp;dan Pemerataan</strong></p>

<p>Lanskap&nbsp; pendidikan tinggi Indonesia&nbsp; juga ditandai dengan pertumbuhan penyelenggaraan oleh lembaga swasta. Dari 3794 jumlah lembaga pendidikan tinggi, 96,3% adalah swasta sedangkan negeri sebesar 38,3% dari pendaftaran.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bila dibandingkan dengan negara-negara lain di ASEAN, APK Indonesia&nbsp; untuk pendidikan tinggi relatif rendah. Hanya 27.10% dari anak muda di kelompok usia 19 - 23 yang terdaftar di pendidikan tinggi di Indonesia pada tahun 2010, yang merupakan setengah dari APK Thailand.</li>
	<li>Umumnya Jawa, terutama Jakarta dan Jogjakarta, dianggap menyediakan kualitas pendidikan tinggi yang lebih baik, sehingga menimbulkan tingkat transisi yang sangat tinggi di dua provinsi tersebut. Orang tua dari provinsi lain sering memilih untuk mengirim anak-anak mereka ke dua kota tersebut meskipun mereka harus menanggung biaya hidup tambahan.</li>
	<li>Hal ini memperlihatkan adanya kesenjangan yang sangat luas pada tingkat pendaftaran antara kuintil terkaya 20% dan empat kelompok lainnya.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Ketidaksetaraan gender meningkat karena siswa berasal dari berbagai tingkat PT, meskipun ada variasi antara lembaga-lembaga negeri dan swasta. Mahasiswi mayoritas ada di tingkat diploma (S0) pada setiapr lembaga (kecuali di &nbsp;lembaga swasta berbasis keagamaan). Namun, rasio perempuan terhadap laki-laki cenderung turun pada setiap tingkat di atas. Pada saat tingkat tertinggi tercapai - PhD atau S3 - perempuan menyumbang sekitar 17% (lembaga negeri berbasis keagamaan) dan 36% (di lembaga negeri umum) dari total pendaftaran. Alasan penurunan ini perlu diteliti lebih lanjut, misalnya faktor sikap sosial, dan ekonomi serta keluarga.</li>
	<li>Seperti yang telah disebutkan sebelumnya, lembaga-lembaga negeri di bawah Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, yang mencapai sekitar 6% total jumlah PT di dalam negeri, bertanggung jawab untuk sekitar 47% dari total pendaftaran di PT. Kecuali beberapa lembaga swasta besar seperti Universitas Bina Nusantara, Universitas Trisakti, dan Universitas Gunadarma, sebagian besar lembaga swasta lain cenderung jauh lebih kecil. Lembaga PTS kecil tanpa subsidi pemerintah tergantung pada biaya kuliah siswa dan biaya lainnya untuk memenuhi semua biaya kegiatan pendidikan. Dengan anggaran yang sangat kecil, diragukan apakah lembaga akan mampu menarik dosen berkualitas dan memberikan pengajaran dan dukungan belajar yang memadai.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Kualitas</u></p>

<p><strong>Personil</strong></p>

<p>Hanya sekitar 38% dosen memiliki gelar Master , gelar doktor, atau gelar spesialis di tingkat master atau doktor.</p>

<p><strong>Akreditasi</strong></p>

<p>Menurut laporan BAN-PT tahun 2012, kualitas banyak PT di Indonesia masih rendah. Misalnya dari semua program yang diberikan oleh PTN dan PTS, ada total 14.489 program studi pendidikan tinggi yang ditawarkan kepada siswa di seluruh Indonesia, termasuk oleh &nbsp;PTN yang berkualitas (kecuali beberapa perguruan tinggi swasta yang mapan). Proporsi yang signifikan (20,5%) dari total jumlah program studi belum terakreditasi, karena terbatasnya jumlah asesor dan sejumlah besar program-program studi yang perlu dikaji; lebih dari setengahnya adalah (67%) swasta.</p>

<p>Pada tingkat diploma, 67,6% dari program studi yang disediakan oleh PTN telah terakreditasi A atau B, dibandingkan dengan PTS hanya 31,1% dari program yang disediakan. Demikian pula, di tingkat S1, 77,2% dari program studi PTN memiliki akreditasi A atau B, dibandingkan PTS dengan hanya 39,9%. Pada tingkat S2 - S3, perbedaan antara PTN dan PTS lebih parah. Pada tingkat ini, 40,6% program disediakan oleh PTN terakreditasi A, dan hanya 6,4% untuk program yang disediakan oleh PTS.</p>

<p>Pilihan mencakup, namun tidak terbatas pada (bersumber dari OECD / ADB, 2015, lihat referensi di bawah ini):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pemerintah mengadopsi pendekatan terdiferensiasi untuk pengembangan pendidikan tersier. Dasar sistem harus diperluas untuk mengakomodasi proporsi yang lebih besar dari biaya sekolah yang meninggalkan sekolah secara efektif. Perluasan terutama dilakukan melalui institusi yang berorientasi pengajaran dengan profil dan misi yang berbeda namun terdefinisi dengan baik, memberikan masyarakat dan pasar tenaga kerja dengan pengetahuan dan keterampilan yang relevan, dan harus mendukung tujuan inklusi sosial dan keadilan geografis. Perluasan perguruan tinggi dan politeknik merupakan langkah yang menjanjikan dalam arah ini. Bagian atas sistem harus terdiri dari sejumlah kecil universitas berbasis penelitian berkualitas tinggi dan memiliki reputasi tinggi yang dapat bertindak sebagai mesin untuk pengembangan masyarakat Indonesia, ekonomi dan sektor pendidikan tinggi. Di tengahnya harus ada berbagai institusi yang banyak terlibat dengan masyarakat setempat, dan bisnis yang dihadapi dalam produksi lulusan dan penerapan pengetahuan, pengetahuan dan teknologi.</li>
	<li>Kementerian Riset dan Teknologi dan Perguruan Tinggi melakukan tinjauan terhadap skala optimal penyelenggara pendidikan tersier secara regional, dengan mempertimbangkan luasnya, kualitas dan kualitas penawaran program, dengan tujuan untuk menetapkan tolok ukur minimum untuk akreditasi institusional. Kemudian harus mempertimbangkan untuk menawarkan insentif untuk pembelian dan merger, dan kemitraan publik-swasta untuk menangani institusi terlemah. Ini harus melanjutkan moratorium pembentukan institusi pendidikan tinggi swasta yang baru.</li>
	<li>Pemerintah segera memperluas kapasitas akreditasi Badan Nasional Akreditasi Pendidikan Tinggi (BAN-PT), dan memastikan bahwa akreditasi sektor khusus untuk bidang profesional (LAM-PT) didirikan secara efektif.</li>
	<li>Pemerintah memperluas kebijaksanaan yang tersedia bagi institusi otonom tingkat atas atau PTN-BH melalui pendanaan dana lebih luas untuk kegiatan pengajaran dan penelitian mereka. Institusi PTN-BH harus memiliki akses ke sistem pendanaan ganda untuk penelitian, terdiri dari skema hibah yang kompetitif untuk proyek penemuan dan hibah dana untuk infrastruktur penelitian.</li>
	<li>Kementerian yang bertanggung jawab mengembangkan sebuah program untuk mendukung pengembangan kapasitas kelembagaan agar tingkat otonomi lebih besar mengenai staf dan pembiayaan dapat diberikan secara bertahap pada universitas, institusi, dan politeknik yang lebih luas. Sebagian besar pengangkatan dewan pengawas lembaga pendidikan tinggi harus bersifat eksternal.</li>
	<li>Pemerintah mengizinkan fleksibilitas harga yang lebih tinggi untuk uang sekolah di institusi pendidikan tersier publik. Lembaga harus diminta untuk memberikan sebagian dari kenaikan pendapatan sekolah mereka untuk memberikan beasiswa dan tunjangan untuk siswa dari latar belakang yang lebih miskin.</li>
	<li>Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi melanjutkan dan menambah programnya untuk meningkatkan kualifikasi dosen ke tingkat master dan PhD.</li>

<p>Universities, industries&nbsp;and government still operate as three independent spheres and quite distant from one another. Only a small number of examples show the three spheres cooperated productively, and in which universities developed and shared essential knowledge with the other spheres. None of the three spheres is sufficiently equipped to lead the development of Indonesia&rsquo;s innovation systems. International study visits to Korea and China showed cooperative initiatives to be driven by their respective governments. Given its different political attributes and institutional frameworks, the Indonesian government seemed unable to be as proactive and directive as the respective governments of countries like China or Singapore in realizing a framework for cooperative innovation. In addition, unlike Korea and Japan, Indonesia lacks leading industries capable of contributing to the creation of innovations. In sum, universities are left to the task of pushing UIG partnerships, which are essential for generating accelerated and geographically dispersed economic development, as outlined in MP3EI. For that reason, developing universities across the country into strategic institutions has a special significance for Indonesia.</p>

Hanya sejumlah kecil contoh yang menunjukkan tiga lembaga tersebut bekerjasama secara produktif, dan universitas mengembangkan dan berbagi pengetahuan penting dengan bidang-bidang lain. Tak satu pun dari tiga lembaga siap dengan sistem inovasi pembangunan Indonesia. Kunjungan studi internasional ke Korea dan Cina menunjukkan inisiatif kerjasama yang didorong oleh pemerintah masing-masing. Mengingat sifat politik dan kerangka kerja institusional yang berbeda, pemerintah Indonesia tidak proaktif dan direktif sepereti pemerintah negara lain seperti China atau Singapura dalam mewujudkan kerangka inovasi kerjasama. Selain itu, tidak seperti Korea dan Jepang, Indonesia tidak memiliki industri terkemuka yang mampu memberikan kontribusi bagi penciptaan inovasi. Singkatnya, universitas memiliki tugas penting mendorong kemitraan yang penting untuk menghasilkan percepatan pembangunan ekonomi dan geografis, seperti diuraikan dalam MP3EI.

"33","1","Governance and Autonomy in Higher Education","<p dir=""ltr"">In the current increasingly complex and globalized world, universities are expected to play in a much broader role beyond teaching, research, and innovation. For universities to become pioneers in continuous quality improvement of education, with careful analysis of labour market needs and career paths of graduates is an urgent need for the nation today. University autonomy or institutional autonomy is the prerequisite for ability to meet such expectation. It is the basic and core principle in the university operation to be able to achieve quality in learning process, conducting quality research, and guarding the academic values. If institutions were to be innovative in meeting the future economic needs, they would be expected to be able to operate independently. There never was a greater need for institutions to develop the culture of independence and accountability than today so that they tackle the complicated issues of the further quality improvement needed for Indonesia&rsquo;s future.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In many countries, university autonomy is embedded with its establishment, and called as constitutional autonomy. A university with this status is subject to judicial review and to the legislature&rsquo;s police power and appropriations power. However, its governing board has a significant degree of independent control over many university functions.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In Indonesia the principle of university autonomy has never been legally protected until just recently. The higher education system was established by the colonial government in the 19th century with a purpose of serving the colonial power, and the governance has experienced limited changes since then. In order to promote stronger foundations to support university autonomy, initiatives to strengthen institutional capacity have been carried out. Competitive funding programs, for example, have been in operation since the 1990s in a variety of forms.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Higher education governance and management reform, focusing on increased autonomy in university resource management, has been on the policy agenda at least since the mid 1990&rsquo;s. In 2009 a law regulating the legal entity status of universities was passed. The law, while providing a clearer framework for improving management and governance, was challenged in the constitutional court and was revoked in 2010. The law was considered unconstitutional by the court on the grounds that it tends to impose a uniform legal status and governance system for public as well as private institutions.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Responding to the court decision, a new bill was drafted and the new <a href=""http://risbang.ristekdikti.go.id/regulasi/uu-12-2012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Law 12/2012 on Higher Education</a> was passed. Since the law retains much of the substance of the previous law, it is also being challenged in the constitutional court by a number of parties, though it has not encountered as strong a degree of resistance as the revoked law. A key issue is the extent to which governance and management autonomy principles in the law are consistent with wider policy and regulatory frameworks, e.g. for public finance management and civil service administration.</p>

<p>The first key question to be addressed appertained to the underlining issues of university autonomy is to what extent it is feasible to implement the specific governance and management autonomy principles in respect to the capacities of MoEC (for leadership, oversight and funding mechanisms) and universities (for implementing institutional reforms).</p>

<p>Despite institutional autonomy has been strongly articulated in the higher education law, its implementation is still quite a challenge. With more than 3200 higher education institutions and huge disparities in terms of quality and institutional advancement, the MoEC tends to play more controlling roles rather than systematically decentralize and develop capacity at the university level. Cognizant of the scale and size of the system, it should be admitted that to manage the system centrally is far beyond the existing capacity of the DGHE. Case in hand is the system for opening up new programs or recruiting permanent staff which requires approval from the DGHE.</p>

<p>From the universities&rsquo; points of perspective, it is safe to say that most institutions are unprepared to implement good university governance principles, which is the prerequisite for autonomy. This is partially due to the patronistic model of governance that have been implemented for some times. Consequently, university&rsquo;s leaderships are becoming administrators simply following directives from the higher authority.</p>

<p>The implementation of the aforementioned governance and management autonomy principles within the wider policy and regulatory environment, for example, the financial and human resource management reforms within existing regulatory frameworks for public finance management and civil service administration will definitely face serious challenges. Under the Higher Education Law, the only possible scheme for implementing autonomous governance and management is through the PTN-BH. The main obstacles are to do with the the financial and staffing autonomy. Both the State Finance Law and the Civil Service Law do not provide any room for implementing autonomy principles at the public universities. Under the PTN-BH, however, special scheme for funding allocation and accountability measures have been explicated within the newly issued Government Regulation no 58/2013. This scheme provide an avenue for PTH-BH to excercise greater flexibility in managing its financial resources which gives rise also to flexibility in managing other resources including human resources. The current bill on Civil Service (RUU Aparatur Sipil Negara) do provide an opportunity for professional empolyees such as teachers to follow a special track called Pegawai Pemerintah dengan Perjanjian Kerja (contractual based government employees).</p>

<p>Overall, the implementation of institutional reform to achieve university autonomy as envisaged in the law is feasible. However, this necessitate the MoEC to implement a consistent policy towards higher education autonomy as mandated by the Law on Higher Education, and to systematically develop institutional capacity of the public universities which have the potential to be transformed into PTN-BH. A number of ministerial decrees and government regulations need to be synchronized with the autonomy reform agenda.</p>

	<p>The Law on Higher Education has given ample opportunities for both the government and higher education institutions to improve the overall quality and competitiveness of higher education sector in Indonesia. The implementation of the law, as commented before, would require concerted efforts from the government as well as universities. It requires also consistent policy implementation from different ministries in the government.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>At the central authority, the DGHE is expected to play more facilitating roles and to consistently empower universities improving their academic standing. The five key strategies (quality, relevance, access, affirmation, and governance) will be most effective if the universities are positioned as its strategic partners in achieving the aforementioned goals and strategies. Even within the existing legal constraints, the DGHE is expected to continuously support the implementation of university autonomy while demanding accountability at the same time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Systematic institutional capacity development programs for universities particularly for promoting good university governance should be seriously implemented, facilitated and incentivized by the government. Likewise, universities should commit itself to be accountable and use autonomy as means for achieving its apex of academic excellence.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cognizant of the large size of the system and its vast geographical spread, decentralization is a conditio-sine-qua-non for managing the higher education sector in Indonesia. The system is far too large to be managed centrally by a single authority. Thus the government should seriously consider to gradually delegate its authority to the universities while improving the capacity of universities so that such delegation can be smoothly implemented. In addition, the government is expected also to streamline the system by encouraging and providing incentives for institutions to improve their efficiency by for example merging of small institutions.</p>

","Tata Kelola dan Otonomi Perguruan Tinggi","<p>Di dunia yang semakin kompleks dan mengglobal, universitas diharapkan dapat bermain dalam peran yang jauh lebih luas daripada pengajaran, penelitian, dan inovasi. Agar universitas menjadi pelopor dalam peningkatan kualitas pendidikan secara terus-menerus, dengan analisis kebutuhan pasar dan jalur karir lulusan yang cermat merupakan kebutuhan mendesak bagi bangsa saat ini. Otonomi universitas atau otonomi kelembagaan merupakan prasyarat untuk memenuhi harapan tersebut. Ini adalah prinsip dasar dan inti dalam operasi universitas untuk dapat mencapai kualitas dalam proses pembelajaran, melakukan penelitian yang berkualitas, dan menjaga nilai akademik. Jika institusi menjadi inovatif dalam memenuhi kebutuhan ekonomi masa depan, mereka diharapkan dapat beroperasi secara independen. Tidak pernah ada kebutuhan institusi yang lebih besar untuk mengembangkan budaya independensi dan akuntabilitas daripada sekarang, sehingga mereka mengatasi masalah rumit dari peningkatan kualitas lebih lanjut yang diperlukan untuk masa depan Indonesia.</p>

<p>Di banyak negara, otonomi universitas tertanam dengan pendiriannya, dan disebut otonomi konstitusional. Sebuah universitas dengan status ini tunduk pada judicial review dan kekuatan kekuasaan dan kekuasaan kuadran legislatif. Namun, dewan pengaturnya memiliki tingkat kontrol independen yang signifikan terhadap banyak fungsi universitas.</p>

<p>Di Indonesia prinsip otonomi universitas tidak pernah dilindungi secara hukum sampai baru-baru ini. Sistem pendidikan tinggi didirikan oleh pemerintah kolonial pada abad ke-19 dengan tujuan untuk melayani kekuasaan kolonial, dan pemerintahan telah mengalami perubahan yang terbatas sejak saat itu. Untuk mendorong fondasi yang lebih kuat untuk mendukung otonomi universitas, inisiatif untuk memperkuat kapasitas kelembagaan telah dilakukan. Program pendanaan yang kompetitif, misalnya, telah beroperasi sejak tahun 1990an dalam berbagai bentuk.</p>

<p>Reformasi tata kelola dan manajemen pendidikan yang lebih tinggi, dengan fokus pada peningkatan otonomi dalam pengelolaan sumber daya universitas, telah menjadi agenda kebijakan setidaknya sejak pertengahan tahun 1990an. Pada tahun 2009 sebuah undang-undang yang mengatur status badan hukum universitas telah disahkan. Undang-undang tersebut, sambil memberikan kerangka kerja yang lebih jelas untuk memperbaiki manajemen dan pemerintahan, ditantang di pengadilan konstitusional dan dicabut pada tahun 2010. Undang-undang tersebut dianggap tidak konstitusional oleh pengadilan dengan alasan bahwa undang-undang tersebut cenderung memberlakukan status hukum dan sistem tata kelola yang seragam untuk Publik maupun institusi swasta.</p>

<p>Menanggapi keputusan pengadilan, sebuah RUU baru disusun dan Undang-undang baru 12/2012 tentang Pendidikan Tinggi disahkan. Karena undang-undang tersebut tetap memiliki substansi hukum sebelumnya, undang-undang ini juga ditantang di pengadilan konstitusional oleh sejumlah pihak, meskipun undang-undang tersebut tidak mendapat tingkat resistensi yang kuat seperti undang-undang yang dicabut. Isu utama adalah sejauh mana prinsip-prinsip tata kelola dan pengelolaan otonomi dalam undang-undang sesuai dengan kerangka kebijakan dan peraturan yang lebih luas, mis. Untuk pengelolaan keuangan publik dan administrasi pegawai negeri.</p>

<div class=""collapsible-item-body panel-body"">
<p>Pertanyaan kunci pertama yang harus ditangani terkait dengan isu-isu mendasar tentang otonomi universitas adalah sejauh mana layak menerapkan prinsip-prinsip otonomi tata pemerintahan dan manajemen yang spesifik berkenaan dengan kapasitas MoEC (untuk mekanisme kepemimpinan, pengawasan dan pendanaan) dan universitas ( Untuk menerapkan reformasi kelembagaan).</p>

<p>Meskipun otonomi kelembagaan telah diartikulasikan dengan ketat dalam undang-undang pendidikan tinggi, implementasinya masih merupakan tantangan tersendiri. Dengan lebih dari 2.200 institusi pendidikan tinggi dan perbedaan besar dalam hal peningkatan kualitas dan kelembagaan, Kementerian Perhubungan cenderung memainkan peran yang lebih mengendalikan daripada secara sistematis mendesentralisasikan dan mengembangkan kapasitas di tingkat universitas. Menyadari skala dan ukuran sistem, harus diakui bahwa untuk mengelola sistem secara terpusat jauh melampaui kapasitas DGHE yang ada. Kasus di tangan adalah sistem untuk membuka program baru atau merekrut staf tetap yang memerlukan persetujuan dari DGHE.</p>

<p>Dari sudut pandang universitas, aman untuk mengatakan bahwa kebanyakan institusi tidak siap untuk menerapkan prinsip tata kelola perguruan tinggi yang baik, yang merupakan prasyarat untuk otonomi. Hal ini sebagian disebabkan oleh model patronistik pemerintahan yang telah dilaksanakan beberapa kali. Akibatnya, kepemimpinan universitas menjadi administrator yang hanya mengikuti arahan dari otoritas yang lebih tinggi.</p>

<p>Penerapan prinsip-prinsip otonomi tata kelola dan pengelolaan yang telah disebutkan di atas dalam lingkungan kebijakan dan peraturan yang lebih luas, misalnya, reformasi pengelolaan keuangan dan sumber daya manusia dalam kerangka peraturan yang berlaku untuk pengelolaan keuangan publik dan administrasi pegawai pasti akan menghadapi tantangan serius. Menurut Undang-Undang Pendidikan Tinggi, satu-satunya kemungkinan penerapan tata pemerintahan dan manajemen otonom adalah melalui PTN-BH. Hambatan utamanya berkaitan dengan otonomi keuangan dan kepegawaian. Baik Undang-Undang Keuangan Negara dan Hukum Pegawai Negeri Sipil tidak memberikan ruang untuk menerapkan prinsip otonomi di perguruan tinggi negeri. Namun, di bawah PTN-BH, skema khusus untuk alokasi dana dan tindakan akuntabilitas telah dijelaskan dalam Peraturan Pemerintah yang baru dikeluarkan No. 58/2013. Skema ini memberikan jalan bagi PTH-BH untuk memanfaatkan fleksibilitas yang lebih besar dalam mengelola sumber keuangannya yang juga memunculkan fleksibilitas dalam mengelola sumber daya lain termasuk sumber daya manusia. Tagihan Pegawai Negeri Sipil (RUU Aparatur Sipil Negara) saat ini memberi kesempatan bagi empolye profesional seperti guru untuk mengikuti jalur khusus yang disebut Pegawai Pemerintah dengan Kerja Kerja (pegawai kontrak).</p>

<p>Secara keseluruhan, pelaksanaan reformasi kelembagaan untuk mencapai otonomi universitas sebagaimana dibayangkan dalam undang-undang adalah layak dilakukan. Namun, ini mengharuskan Kementerian Perhubungan untuk menerapkan kebijakan yang konsisten mengenai otonomi pendidikan tinggi sebagaimana diamanatkan oleh Undang-Undang Pendidikan Tinggi, dan untuk secara sistematis mengembangkan kapasitas kelembagaan universitas negeri yang berpotensi untuk diubah menjadi PTN-BH. Sejumlah keputusan menteri dan peraturan pemerintah perlu disinkronkan dengan agenda reformasi otonomi.</p>

	<li>Undang-Undang tentang Pendidikan Tinggi telah memberi banyak kesempatan kepada pemerintah dan institusi pendidikan tinggi untuk meningkatkan kualitas dan daya saing sektor pendidikan tinggi di Indonesia. Pelaksanaan undang-undang tersebut, seperti yang dikemukakan sebelumnya, akan memerlukan usaha bersama dari pemerintah maupun perguruan tinggi. Ini memerlukan implementasi kebijakan yang konsisten dari berbagai kementerian di pemerintahan.</li>
	<li>Di otoritas pusat, DGHE diharapkan dapat memainkan peran yang lebih memfasilitasi dan untuk secara konsisten memberdayakan universitas untuk meningkatkan posisi akademis mereka. Lima strategi utama (kualitas, relevansi, akses, penegasan, dan tata kelola) akan sangat efektif jika universitas diposisikan sebagai mitra strategis dalam mencapai tujuan dan strategi tersebut. Bahkan dalam kendala hukum yang ada, DGHE diharapkan dapat terus mendukung pelaksanaan otonomi universitas sambil menuntut pertanggungjawaban pada saat bersamaan.</li>
	<li>Program pengembangan kapasitas kelembagaan yang sistematis untuk universitas terutama untuk mempromosikan tata kelola universitas yang baik harus dilaksanakan secara serius, difasilitasi dan diinvestasikan oleh pemerintah. Demikian juga, universitas harus berkomitmen untuk bertanggung jawab dan menggunakan otonomi sebagai sarana untuk mencapai puncak kualitas akademis.</li>
	<li>Menyadari besarnya ukuran sistem dan penyebaran geografisnya yang luas, desentralisasi adalah conditio-sine-qua-non untuk mengelola sektor pendidikan tinggi di Indonesia. Sistemnya terlalu besar untuk dikelola secara terpusat oleh satu otoritas. Dengan demikian pemerintah harus secara serius mempertimbangkan untuk secara bertahap mendelegasikan kewenangannya ke universitas sambil meningkatkan kapasitas universitas sehingga delegasi tersebut dapat berjalan dengan lancar. Selain itu, pemerintah juga diharapkan dapat merampingkan sistem dengan mendorong dan memberi insentif kepada institusi untuk meningkatkan efisiensinya dengan misalnya penggabungan lembaga kecil.</li>

"34","1","Maritime Education","<p dir=""ltr"">As one of the largest archipelagic countries in the world, maritime plays a very important role in Indonesia&rsquo;s economy. Indeed, the government has expressed an expectation for maritime&rsquo;s contribution to increase for the country. Unfortunately, matters related to maritime, such as logistics costs, still have a lot to improve in Indonesia. By ASEAN and OECD standards, Indonesia&rsquo;s logistics costs at 25% of GDP is still considered high. The government intends to reduce this cost using sea transport services.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Certainly, commercial shipping, which requires a well-designed maritime education and training (MET) is a major part of such services. A seafarer&rsquo;s career path for officer follows one of two ways: (1) vocational training through diploma-granting institution plus sea service, or (2) non-formal education and training through short courses and experience at sea. In Indonesia, the MOT sets standards for MET providers, assessors, seafarer competences and proficiency levels.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Issues arise at this point. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) provides accreditation for countries&rsquo; MET systems. If Indonesia fails the IMO audit, all Indonesian seafarers would lose their credentials and not be allowed to both work on foreign ships as well as enter foreign ports. In Indonesia, MOEC, MORTHE, and MOT, all offer MET programs, but only 20% of them meet the IMO standards. A common issue is training providers&rsquo; inability to provide sufficient practical experience through the likes of simulators. Foundational materials tend not to carry the context of maritime and teaching materials tend to fail to speak to seafarers.</p>

<p>While there are some excellent vocational senior secondary schools (SMK) and higher education institutions (HEIs), the formal education component at the system level for Maritime Education and Training is inefficient and not sufficiently effective at preparing graduates for their first job at sea. Efforts to reform the overall MET system at the provider level are hampered by inconsistencies at the governance and institutional levels. The unreconciled differences between standards for Accreditation (under MoEC and MoRTHE) and standards for Approval (under MoT) render it nearly impossible for MET provision to align with both under the current regulatory framework. The formal component of the MET system does not match supply of graduates to meet the current or future demand in quantity and quality for skilled and highly skilled seafarers. Moreover, the current MET system exposes Indonesia&rsquo;s commercial shipping industry to unnecessary risks should it fail the IMO audit expected in 2018.</p>

","Pendidikan Maritim","<p>Sebagai salah satu negara kepulauan terbesar di dunia, maritim memainkan peran yang sangat penting dalam perekonomian Indonesia. Memang, pemerintah telah menyatakan harapan untuk kontribusi maritim terhadap peningkatan negara. Sayangnya, hal yang berkaitan dengan kelautan, seperti biaya logistik, masih harus banyak memperbaiki di Indonesia. Dengan standar ASEAN dan OECD, biaya logistik Indonesia sebesar 25% dari PDB masih dianggap tinggi. Pemerintah bermaksud mengurangi biaya ini dengan menggunakan jasa transportasi laut.</p>

<p>Tentu saja, pengiriman komersial, yang membutuhkan pendidikan dan pelatihan maritim yang dirancang dengan baik (MET) adalah bagian utama dari layanan semacam itu. Jalur karir pelaut untuk petugas mengikuti salah satu dari dua cara berikut: (1) pelatihan kejuruan melalui lembaga pemberian beasiswa dan layanan laut, atau (2) pendidikan dan pelatihan non-formal melalui kursus singkat dan pengalaman di laut. Di Indonesia, MOT menetapkan standar untuk penyedia MET, asesor, kompetensi pelaut dan tingkat kemahiran.</p>

<p>Isu muncul pada saat ini. Organisasi Maritim Internasional (International Maritime Organization / IMO) menyediakan akreditasi untuk sistem MET negara-negara. Jika Indonesia gagal dalam audit IMO, semua pelaut Indonesia akan kehilangan kepercayaan mereka dan tidak diizinkan bekerja di kapal asing maupun memasuki pelabuhan asing. Di Indonesia, MOEC, MORTHE, dan MOT, semua menawarkan program MET, namun hanya 20% di antaranya memenuhi standar IMO. Isu yang umum adalah ketidakmampuan penyedia pelatihan untuk memberikan pengalaman praktis yang memadai melalui simulator semacam itu. Bahan dasar cenderung tidak membawa konteks bahan ajar maritim dan pengajaran cenderung gagal berbicara dengan pelaut.</p>

<p>Meskipun ada beberapa sekolah menengah kejuruan veteran dan institusi pendidikan tinggi (HEI), komponen pendidikan formal di tingkat sistem untuk Pendidikan dan Pelatihan Maritim tidak efisien dan tidak cukup efektif untuk mempersiapkan lulusan untuk pekerjaan pertama mereka di laut. Upaya untuk mereformasi keseluruhan sistem MET di tingkat penyedia terhambat oleh inkonsistensi di tingkat pemerintahan dan kelembagaan. Perbedaan yang tidak didamaikan antara standar untuk Akreditasi (berdasarkan MoEC dan MoRTHE) dan standar untuk Persetujuan (dalam Kemenhut) membuat hampir tidak mungkin bagi MET provision untuk menyelaraskan dengan keduanya di bawah kerangka peraturan saat ini. Komponen formal sistem MET tidak sesuai dengan pasokan lulusan untuk memenuhi permintaan saat ini atau masa depan kuantitas dan kualitas pelaut terampil dan terampil.

	<p>Radical Islamic community organizations can interpret Islam and its relationship with daily life in a way that differs from the presentation students receive in school. When radical interpretations of Islam offer simple explanations to complex issues such as pluralism and tolerance, these interpretations can be attractive. Thus, Islam as taught by these organizations could potentially compete with the Islamic religious education given in schools It is important to note that not all Islamic community organizations offer radical understandings of Islam. Many Islamic community organizations are moderate and have many followers including teachers and students of regular schools.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another channel through which a radical message infiltrates schools indirectly, from a source that is external to the school, is through the mass media, especially television, as well as through parents and family members, neighbors, extracurricular student organizations and the extra-curricular activities of schools. Television and radio tend to be the most popular among these channels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Community organizations are also attractive because they offer kinship, to which young students in SMP and SMA are drawn. A collegial kinship is a form of social contact that many youngsters prefer and that inspires them to be actively involved in various organizations, including Islamic radical community organizations.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>One way of mitigating the influence of radical views is to employ local wisdom, if such wisdom has been helpful in facilitating tolerance amongst pluralistic communities. In North Sulawesi, for example, the motto used is &ldquo;Torang Samua Basudara&rdquo; (we are all families). Another example is Medan, which adopts a tolerant and inclusive perspective on inter-faith relationships by upholding the marga (clan).</p>

	<li>The Center for Curriculum and Books (PusKurBuk) under MoEC is responsible for the curriculum and textbooks in Indonesia. Certain MoRA staff members were involved in developing the content for religious subjects and in writing the texts and teachers&rsquo; guides. However, involvement of MoRA was not the result of an institutional collaboration, but only collaboration on a personal basis. As a result, some dissatisfaction has been expressed with the quality and accuracy of the presentation of some religious topics in the new textbooks.</li>

","Memerangi Radikalisme - Budaya Damai","<p>Negara-negara majemuk seperti Indonesia mengembangkan hidup berdampingan secara damai dari masyarakat dengan keyakinan, minat dan gaya hidup yang berbeda. Konstitusi Indonesia mengakui pluralisme dan keragaman agama dan menyatakan bahwa, &ldquo;negara menjamin kebebasan semua orang dalam beribadah sesuai dengan agama dan kepercayaan masing-masing &rdquo; ( Pasal 29). Namun, tindakan intoleransi telah banyak diberitakan di Indonesia dan di seluruh dunia, dan mereka kini mempertanyakan&nbsp; komitmen nyata masyarakat tentang prinsip-prinsip pluralisme dan ide-ide kesetaraan dalam keberagaman.</p>

<p>Menurut sebuah penelitian yang dibantu oleh ACDP Indonesia &nbsp;dan ditugaskan oleh Direktorat Pendidikan Islam, pendidikan Islam formal memiliki peran penting dalam memperkenalkan budaya dan nilai-nilai toleransi dan perdamaian. Penelitian ini menyatakan bahwa sudah ada nilai-nilai dan prinsip-prinsip yang memperkenalkan perdamaian, yang melekat dalam kurikulum. Namun, implementasi yang lebih baik diperlukan. Penelitian ini juga memberikan rekomendasi agar pendidikan agama Islam formal dapat diajarkan secara lebih baik untuk mencegah tindak kekerasan.</p>

	<li>Organisasi masyarakat Islam radikal menafsirkan Islam dan hubungannya dengan kehidupan sehari-hari dengan cara yang berbeda dengan yang didapat siswa di sekolah. Ketika interpretasi radikal Islam menawarkan penjelasan sederhana untuk masalah kompleks seperti pluralisme dan toleransi, interpretasi ini menjadi menarik. Dengan demikian, Islam seperti yang diajarkan oleh organisasi-organisasi ini berpotensi bersaing dengan pendidikan agama Islam yang diberikan di sekolah-sekolah. Penting untuk diketahui bahwa tidak semua organisasi masyarakat Islam menawarkan pemahaman Islam radikal. Banyak organisasi masyarakat Islam yang moderat dan memiliki banyak pengikut termasuk guru dan siswa dari sekolah umum.</li>
	<li>Saluran lain masuknya paham radikal ke sekolah secara tidak langsung, dari sumber yang berada di luar sekolah, yakni melalui media massa, terutama televisi, serta melalui orang tua dan anggota keluarga, tetangga, organisasi ekstra-kurikuler mahasiswa dan kegiatan ekstra kurikuler sekolah. Televisi dan radio cenderung menjadi media yang paling diminati diantara saluran tersebut.</li>
	<li>Organisasi masyarakat tersebut juga menarik karena mereka menawarkan kekerabatan, dimana anak-anak muda di tingkat SMP dan SMA yang diambil. Kekerabatan kolegial adalah bentuk kontak sosial yang banyak dipilih oleh anak muda dan menginspirasi mereka menjadi aktif terlibat dalam berbagai organisasi, termasuk organisasi masyarakat Islam radika.</li>
	<li>Salah satu cara untuk mengurangi pengaruh pandangan radikal adalah dengan menggunakan kearifan lokal, terutama dalam kasus di mana kearifan lokal yang sebelumnya telah membantu munculnya toleransi di antara masyarakat pluralistik. Di Sulawesi Utara, misalnya, moto yang digunakan adalah &ldquo; Torang Samua Basudara &rdquo; (kita semua keluarga). Contoh lain adalah Medan, yang mengadopsi perspektif toleran dan inklusif hubungan antar&nbsp; agama dengan menjunjung tinggi marga (klan).</li>
	<li>Pusat Kurikulum dan Buku (PusKurBuk) di bawah Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan bertanggung jawab untuk kurikulum dan buku teks di Indonesia. Meskipun PusKurBuk berkonsultasi dengan staf Kemenag&nbsp; pada saat&nbsp; pengembangan buku teks dan kurikulum, keterlibatan Kemenag bukanlah hasil dari kolaborasi kelembagaan, tetapi hanya kolaborasi secara pribadi. Akibatnya, ada beberapa ketidakpuasan terkait kualitas dan akurasi penyajian beberapa topik agama di buku-buku pelajaran baru.</li>

<p><u>The National Education Standards </u></p>

<p>An objective of the study was to determine the extent to which Ministerial Decrees No. 12/2007 and 13/2007 have been implemented by districts. Findings from the study clearly indicated that the current Principal and Supervisor standards are not fully understood by a large proportion of the individuals and groups for whom they were designed. A number of principals even said that they did not have copies of the relevant standards. In some districts and regions there was a genuine problem in accessing the standards. In others, the fact that principals and supervisors did not have a copy seemed to reflect a failure of interest and commitment rather than a failure of access and availability, as all the NES can be downloaded from the BSNP website.</p>

<p>Socialization of the standards was patchy across different districts and many principals, supervisors, and heads of district education offices did not use the standards for the purposes they were designed, including selection, monitoring and professional development purposes. During the field visits many principals and supervisors commented that local factors, especially the opinion of the head of the district education office and the Bupati/Walikota, were decisive in the selection process. It was also interesting to note from the field study visits that many supervisors do not appear to have been selected using formal selection processes. These findings raise the more general issue of how the national education system can ensure the implementation of national regulations in districts. This has implications beyond the implementation of the NES and even the education sector and the solution is outside the scope of this study.</p>

<p>MoRA supervisors indicated in the quantitative surveys that they had problems in collecting information about the achievement of the NES. It was also apparent in the field study visits that a significant proportion of supervisors and principals had little understanding of the content of the NES, the implications of the standards for their roles or how they could be used to benefit the school, and improve the quality of learning outcomes for students. Virtually, no respondents made the link between the achievement of the standards and the improvement of student learning.</p>

<p>Detailed content analysis of the NES indicators by the team led them to the conclusion that, compared to international practice, the four sets of standards (Supervisor, Principal, School Management and Teacher) used in the design and implementation of the study were excessively complex, yet at the same time were deficient in some key areas. An example is the lack of a teaching and learning leadership dimension in the Principal Standard.</p>

<p>The issue of the relevance of the standards was also apparent in the comparative ratings of competency and CPD needs for supervisors in the quantitative surveys. While competency ratings were by far the lowest on the Research and Development dimension, this dimension did not receive consistently high ratings of priority for future CPD. This suggests that supervisors may not see this as a particularly relevant dimension for their roles. This was confirmed in the field visits, where supervisors consistently rated other dimensions as being more important for their roles.</p>

<p><u><a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=17"" target=""_blank"">Principal</a> and <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=18"" target=""_blank"">Supervisor</a> Competency </u></p>

<p>The study identified the competency strengths and weakness of principals and supervisors at the competency dimension and competency indicator levels. The findings discussed here were confirmed by at least two sources of evidence from the study to ensure that stakeholders can have confidence in the findings.</p>

<p>There were a number of areas where principal and supervisor ratings of competency are generally satisfactory, particularly:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Personality/Character and Social for both groups</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Most aspects of Managerial and Teaching and Counselling for public school/madrasah principals</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Most aspects of Managerial Supervision and Educational Evaluation, and some aspects of Academic Supervision for supervisors.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>However, for supervisors there is a need to strengthen their competency in:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All aspects of Research and Development</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Managerial Supervision &ndash; particularly planning and implementing supervision programs, preparing supervision reports, using the results of supervision to improve practice, and monitoring the implementation of their recommendations for implementation action</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Academic Supervision &ndash; particularly their understanding of student development, learning processes, and how to guide and provide advice to teachers about subject areas, student learning, and the use of practical work to improve student learning</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Educational Evaluation &ndash; particularly their capacity to develop indicators of learning achievement and their ability to process and use data for improvement purposes</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Leading Change, Improvement and Innovation &ndash; some supervisors felt they lacked access to up-to-date and important educational information and training and this limited their capacity to assist teachers to improve their performance.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>For principals there is a need to focus improvement programs on Managerial, Supervision and Entrepreneurship competency dimensions. There were important differences in levels of competency for different sub-groups. In particular, principals of private madrasah, principals in remote and rural locations, principals of Level B and C accredited schools, and female principals had lower ratings of competency for Managerial, Supervision and Entrepreneurship dimensions.</p>

<p>The major issues facing MoEC and MoRA are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Determining the appropriate strategies for improving supervisor and principal capacity in these areas.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Identifying the resources needed to implement the improvement program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Ensuring the cooperation and commitment of local government and key stakeholders for their development and implementation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Monitoring and evaluating the impact of improvement strategies.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Using the findings from evaluation and monitoring studies to improve all schools and all teachers.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Along with competency deficiencies of principals, especially private madrasah principals, and supervisors in key areas related to their roles, the other study findings that the team was concerned about were:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The lack of access to and participation in preparation programs for new supervisors and principals and the need for more effective induction programs. MoEC has established the <a href=""http://lppks.kemdikbud.go.id/"" target=""_blank"">Principal Development and Empowerment Institution (LPPKS)</a> which provides principal preparation programs but there is as yet no equivalent for supervisors.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The inconsistency in the monitoring and supervision of the performance and achievements of principals and supervisors, and by principals and supervisors for the staff they should be monitoring.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The inability of supervisors and principals to analyze and use performance data to improve educational quality and outcomes.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The anecdotal evidence indicated that local political considerations played a significant role in selection and appointment processes to the detriment of merit-based selection procedures.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>These matters, together with longer-term improvements in capacity and competency, can only be addressed successfully with a coordinated, nationally agreed improvement strategy.</p>

<p><u>CPD and INPRES Practices</u></p>

<p>The findings about the methodologies used in the INPRES training provided some important information about effective approaches to CPD Indonesia. Participants in INPRES training were generally positive about the methodologies used, especially the balance between face-to-face input, workplace application, and mentoring. In addition, there was some evidence that the training improved the competency of the principal and supervisor participants. However, there is no evidence available to determine if this is a long term effect that also leads to improvements in educational quality in schools or improvements to student learning outcomes. The approaches used in INPRES, however, reflected the findings of international research that emphasizes the need for longer-term professional development relevant to the role of the participant. These approaches were received positively by participants. However, in addition to these methodologies there are a number of other international research findings about effective professional development that will also be critical for future CPD in Indonesia.</p>

<p>The first is the need to ensure that teams of people from the same workplace participate together in CPD so that the team learns together and applies its learning in the workplace. Sending a single person to a training workshop and expecting them to change a whole workplace is unrealistic and has been found to be very ineffective. The second is the need to ensure that CPD programs use effective adult learning principals. Adult learners need to participate in active learning experiences during face-to-face workshops. The third is the need to identify and build the capacity of local champions for educational improvement that has the authority and commitment to lead and drive change and improvement. One of the key issues raised in the field visits was the significance of the local political context in which schools operate. It is apparent from the findings about the implementation of the NES that the promulgation of national regulations does not guarantee that they will be implemented locally. Last but not least is the need to monitor and evaluate the impact of CPD on participant practice in the workplace.</p>

<p>The study found evidence to indicate that participation in INPRES training had a positive impact on principal and supervisor competency. This suggests that it would be beneficial to extend the training program to a wider group of principals and supervisors, particularly principals of private madrasah. However, before extending the program it is recommended that MoEC and MoRA: (1) Investigate the reasons for the non-completion of the program by a substantial number of participants; (2) Check to determine the extent of participant substitution during the course of the program; (3) Consider the extension of the program only within the framework of nationally planned strategy to improve the quality of education and competency improvement; (4) Develop a more robust strategy for monitoring the impact and benefits of the program on competency and school improvement.</p>

<p>Standar Nasional Pendidikan</p>

<p>Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk menentukan sejauh mana Keputusan Menteri No. 12/2007 dan 13/2007 telah dilaksanakan oleh kabupaten. Temuan dari penelitian ini jelas menunjukkan bahwa standar Kepala Sekolah dan Pengawas saat ini tidak sepenuhnya dipahami oleh sebagian besar individu dan kelompok untuk siapa standar tersebut dirancang. Sejumlah kepala sekolah bahkan mengatakan bahwa mereka tidak memiliki salinan dari standar yang dimaksud. Di beberapa kabupaten dan wilayah masih ada permasalahan untuk mengakses standar tersebut. Adanya fakta bahwa kepala sekolah dan pengawas tidak memiliki salinan standar tersebut tampaknya mencerminkan tidak adanya minat dan komitmen bukan masalah akses atau ketersediaan, karena sebenarnya semua SNP dapat didownload dari situs BSNP.</p>

<p>Sosialisasi standar tambal sulam di berbagai kabupaten dan banyak kepala sekolah, pengawas, dan kepala dinas pendidikan kabupaten tidak menggunakan standar sebagaimana &nbsp;tujuan awalnya, seperti untuk seleksi, monitoring dan tujuan pengembangan profesional. Selama kunjungan lapangan, banyak Kepala Sekolah dan Pengawas&nbsp; &nbsp;berpendapat bahwa faktor lokal, terutama pendapat kepala dinas pendidikan kabupaten dan Bupati / Walikota, menentukan dalam proses seleksi. Hal ini juga menarik untuk dicatat dari kunjungan studi lapangan bahwa banyak pengawas yang dipilih tidak dengan menggunakan proses seleksi formal. Temuan ini mengangkat isu yang lebih umum tentang bagaimana sistem pendidikan nasional dapat memastikan pelaksanaan peraturan nasional di kabupaten. Hal ini memiliki implikasi pelaksanaan SNP dan bahkan sektor pendidikan dan solusinya berada di luar lingkup penelitian ini.</p>

<p>Pengawas Kemenag sebagaimana terlihat dalam survei kuantitatif mereka memiliki masalah dalam mengumpulkan informasi tentang pencapaian SNP . Hal ini juga terlihat dalam kunjungan studi lapangan diman ada banyak pengawas dan kepala sekolah yang memiliki sedikit pemahaman tentang isi dari SNP, implikasi dari standar untuk peran mereka atau bagaimana mereka dapat dimanfaatkan untuk sekolah, dan meningkatkan kualitas hasil belajar bagi siswa. Hampir, tidak ada responden yang menghubungkan antara pencapaian standar dan peningkatan belajar siswa.</p>

<p>Analisis isi indikator SNP yang rinci oleh tim menyimpulkan bahwa, dibandingkan dengan praktek internasional, empat set standar (Pengawas, Kepala Sekolah, Manajemen Sekolah dan Guru) yang digunakan dalam desain dan pelaksanaan penelitian ini adalah sangat kompleks, namun pada saat yang sama kekurangan di beberapa bidang utama. Contohnya adalah kurangnya dimensi kepemimpinan pembelajaran dan pengajaran &nbsp;dalam Standard Kepala Sekolah.</p>

<p>Masalah relevansi standar juga tampak dalam penilaian komparatif kompetensi dan PKB memerlukan &nbsp;pengawas dalam survei kuantitatif. Walaupun peringkat kompetensi adalah yang terendah pada dimensi Penelitian dan Pengembangan, dimensi ini tidak mendapatkan prioritas lebih &nbsp;dalam PKB mendatang. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa menurut pengawas dimensi ini&nbsp; tidak relevan dengan peran mereka. Hal ini dikonfirmasi dalam kunjungan lapangan, di mana pengawas secara konsisten menilai bahwa ada dimensi lain yang lebih penting untuk peran mereka.</p>

<p>Kompetensi Kepala Sekolah dan Pengawas</p>

<p>Penelitian ini mengidentifikasi kekuatan dan kelemahan kompetensi kepala sekolah dan pengawas di dimensi kompetensi dan indikator kompetensi. Temuan yang dibahas di sini dikonfirmasi oleh setidaknya dua sumber bukti dari penelitian untuk memastikan bahwa para pemangku kepentingan dapat meyakini temuan yang diperoleh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ada sejumlah bidang di mana peringkat kompetensi kepala sekolah dan pengawas umumnya memuaskan, terutama: &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kepribadian / Karakter dan Sosial kedua kelompok</li>
	<li>Sebagian besar aspek manajerial dan Pengajaran dan Konseling untuk kepala sekolah umum / madrasah</li>
	<li>Sebagian besar aspek Pengawasan Manajerial dan Evaluasi Pendidikan, dan beberapa aspek Pengawasan Akademik untuk pengawas. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Namun, untuk pengawas ada kebutuhan untuk memperkuat kompetensi mereka pada:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Semua aspek Penelitian dan Pengembangan</li>
	<li>Pengawasan manajerial - terutama perencanaan dan pelaksanaan program pengawasan, pembuatan laporan pengawasan, penggunaan hasil pengawasan untuk meningkatkan praktek, dan monitoring pelaksanaan rekomendasi mereka untuk tindakan pelaksanaan</li>
	<li>Pengawasan akademik - terutama pemahaman mereka tentang perkembangan siswa, proses pembelajaran, dan bagaimana membimbing dan memberikan saran kepada guru tentang bidang studi, belajar siswa, dan penggunaan kerja praktek untuk meningkatkan belajar siswa</li>
	<li>Evaluasi pendidikan - terutama kapasitas mereka dalam mengembangkan indikator prestasi belajar dan kemampuan mereka untuk memproses dan menggunakan data untuk tujuan perbaikan</li>
	<li>Memimpin Perubahan, Perbaikan dan Inovasi - beberapa supervisor merasa mereka tidak&nbsp; memiliki akses pada&nbsp; informasi dan pelatihan pendidikan terkini dan penting dan hal ini membatasi mereka dalam membantu guru untuk meningkatkan kinerja mereka.</li>
</ol>

<p>Kepala sekolah perlu fokus pada program peningkatan dimensi kompetensi Manajerial, Pengawasan dan Kewirausahaan. Ada perbedaan penting dalam tingkat kompetensi untuk sub-kelompok yang berbeda. Secara khusus, kepala sekolah madrasah swasta, kepala sekolah di lokasi terpencil dan pedesaan, kepala sekolah dari sekolah terakreditasi B dan C, dan kepala sekolah perempuan memiliki peringkat lebih rendah dalam dimensi kompetensi manajerial, Pengawasan dan Kewirausahaan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Masalah-masalah utama yang dihadapi Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan dan Kementerian Agama adalah:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Menentukan strategi yang tepat untuk meningkatkan kapasitas pengawas dan kepala sekolah di daerah-daerah.</li>
	<li>Mengidentifikasi sumber daya yang dibutuhkan untuk melaksanakan program perbaikan.</li>
	<li>Memastikan kerjasama dan komitmen dari pemerintah daerah dan pemangku kepentingan utama untuk pengembangan dan pelaksanaannya.</li>
	<li>Memantau dan mengevaluasi dampak dari strategi perbaikan.</li>
	<li>Menggunakan temuan dari penelitian tentang evaluasi dan monitoring untuk meningkatkan semua sekolah dan guru.</li>
</ul>

<p>Seiring dengan kekurangan kompetensi pada kepala sekolah, kepala sekolah madrasah terutama swasta, dan pengawas di bidang utama yang terkait dengan peran mereka, temuan penelitian lain yang harus diperhatikan adalah:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kurangnya akses dan partisipasi dalam program persiapan untuk pengawas dan kepala sekolah baru dan kebutuhan untuk program induksi yang lebih efektif. Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan telah mendirikan LPPKS yang menyediakan program persiapan kepala sekolah tetapi belum ada forum yang setara untuk pengawas.</li>
	<li>Inkonsistensi dalam pemantauan dan pengawasan kinerja dan prestasi kepala sekolah dan pengawas..</li>
	<li>Ketidakmampuan pengawas dan kepala sekolah dalam menganalisis dan menggunakan data kinerja untuk meningkatkan kualitas dan hasil pendidikan.</li>
	<li>Bukti anekdotal menunjukkan bahwa pertimbangan politik lokal memainkan peran penting dalam proses seleksi dan pengangkatan dan merugikan prosedur seleksi berbasis prestasi.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hal ini, bersama-sama dengan perbaikan jangka panjang dalam kapasitas dan kompetensi, hanya dapat berhasil diatasi dengan strategi peningkatan yang terkoordinasi dan disepakati secara nasional.</p>

<p>PKB dan Praktek INPRES</p>

<p>Temuan tentang metodologi yang digunakan dalam pelatihan INPRES memberikan beberapa informasi penting tentang pendekatan yang efektif untuk PKB Indonesia. Peserta pelatihan INPRES umumnya positif dengan metodologi yang digunakan, terutama keseimbangan antara tatap muka, penerapan di tempat kerja, dan mentoring. Selain itu, ada bukti bahwa pelatihan meningkatkan kompetensi kepala sekolah dan pengawas sebagai peserta. Namun demikian, tidak ada bukti yang tersedia untuk menentukan apakah ada efek jangka panjang yang mendorong adanya perbaikan kualitas pendidikan di sekolah-sekolah atau perbaikan hasil belajar siswa. Pendekatan yang digunakan dalam INPRES, bagaimanapun, mencerminkan temuan penelitian internasional yang menekankan pentingnya pengembangan profesional jangka panjang yang relevan dengan peran peserta. Pendekatan ini diterima positif oleh peserta. Namun, selain metodologi ada sejumlah temuan penelitian internasional lainnya mengenai pengembangan profesional yang efektif yang juga akan menjadi penting bagi masa depan PKB di Indonesia.</p>

<p>Yang pertama adalah perlunya memastikan agar &nbsp;tim adalah orang-orang dari tempat kerja yang sama berpartisipasi dalam PKB sehingga tim belajar bersama-sama dan menerapkan pembelajarannya di tempat kerja mereka. Mengirim satu orang untuk mengikuti workshop pelatihan dan mengharapkannya dapat mengubah seluruh tempat kerjanya merupakan hal yang &nbsp;tidak realistis dan sangat tidak efektif. Yang kedua pentingya untuk memastikan bahwa program PKB menggunakan pendekatan pembelajaran orang dewasa yang efektif. Pembelajar dewasa harus berpartisipasi dalam pengalaman belajar aktif selama workshop tatap muka. Yang ketiga adalah pentingnya mengidentifikasi dan membangun kapasitas juara dalam perbaikan pendidikan yang memiliki kewenangan dan komitmen untuk memimpin dan menggerakkan perubahan dan perbaikan. Salah satu isu utama yang diangkat dalam kunjungan lapangan adalah pentingnya konteks politik lokal di mana sekolah beroperasi. Hal ini terlihat dari temuan tentang pelaksanaan SNP &nbsp;dimana pemberlakuan &nbsp;peraturan nasional tidak menjamin akan dilaksanakan secara lokal. Yang terakhir adalah &nbsp;pentingnya memantau dan mengevaluasi dampak dari PKB pada praktek peserta di tempat kerja.</p>

<p>Studi ini menemukan bukti yang menunjukkan bahwa partisipasi dalam pelatihan INPRES memiliki dampak positif pada kompetensi kepala sekolah dan pengawas. Hal ini menunjukkan perlunya memperpanjang program pelatihan untuk kelompok yang lebih luas dari kepala sekolah dan pengawas, khususnya kepala sekolah madrasah swasta. Namun, sebelum memperluas program dianjurkan bahwa Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan dan Kemenag: (1) mengetahui alas an mengapa sebagian besar peserta tidak menyelesaikan &nbsp;program; (2) mmeriksa &nbsp;pergantian &nbsp;peserta selama program; (3) mempertimbangkan perpanjangan program hanya berdasarkan kerangka strategi yang direncanakan secara nasional untuk meningkatkan kualitas pendidikan dan peningkatan kompetensi; (4) Mengembangkan strategi yang lebih baik untuk memantau dampak dan manfaat program kompetensi dan perbaikan sekolah.</p>

<p><u>Provider of ECD</u></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Institutionally driven approaches have demonstrated quick improvements in ECD participation rates, but the achievements may not be sustainable as they depend on short-term financing.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Communities are capable of developing ECD and HI ECD initiatives on their own, but they require much more investment in time by skilled facilitators and frequently benefit from external input either through funding or capacity building.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Local Delivery</u></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Poor coordination between central and provincial levels persists, making implementation of provision at district and community level problematic.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Overlapping and sometimes unclear division of responsibilities between central, provincial, and district levels hampers the efficient operations of ECD and HI ECD.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>HI ECD cannot be realized without an informed and systematic process of decision-making at the local level. Yet, there is no current development model for creating sustainable local level support for HI ECD.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Public investment may not be targeted well to improve equity, as current financing models tend to favor centers with more capacity for self-financing and public support for training materials and operational support.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Maternal and child health components of HI ECD are more favorably resourced than ECD.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Public investment at the point of delivery is dependent on transfers from the National budget. 90% of revenues accrue from national transfers and an estimated 60% of activities implemented in the community are executed by a national entity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The functioning of many centers that resulted from national budget provision for about 1.9 million children (per year) is only possible through voluntary labor given by the caregivers.</p>

	<li>Masyarakat mampu mengembangkan PAUD dan PAUD HI dengan inisiatif sendiri, namun PAUD tersebut memerlukan fasilitator yang terampil dan kemampuan memanfaatkan input eksternal baik berupa dana atau pembangunan kapasitas.</li>
</ul>

	<li>Adanya koordinasi yang buruk antara tingkat pusat dan provinsi membuat penyelenggaraannya di kabupaten dan masyarakat bermasalah.</li>
	<li>Pembagian tanggung jawab &nbsp;yang tumpang tindih dan kadang-kadang tidak jelas antara tingkat pusat, provinsi, dan kabupaten menghambat efisiensi penyelenggaraan dari PAUD dan PAUD HI.</li>
	<li>PAUD HI tidak dapat terwujud tanpa proses pengambilan keputusan yang jelas dan sistematis di tingkat daerah. Namun, saat ini tidak ada model pengembangan dalam mendorong bantuan daeerah yang berkelanjutan untuk HI ECD.</li>

<p>Pembiayaan PAUD</p>

<ul>
	<li>Investasi pemerintah mungkin tidak dapat meningkatkan pemerataan, karena model pembiayaan saat ini cenderung mendorong pusat pengembangan ini untuk mampu membiayai sendiri dan bantuan pemerintah untuk bahan pelatihan dan operasional.</li>
	<li>komponen kesehatan ibu dan anak di PAUD HI lebih banyak tersedia dibanding di PAUD.</li>

"38","1","Quality Assurance in Early Childhood Education","<p>Quality Assurance (QA) refers to a systematic and effective process of checking to see whether a service being developed is meeting specified requirements or standards. In order to improve the capacity of children (from birth to 6 years of age) to develop and learn, early childhood education (ECE) services should be of high quality and the providers need to be held accountable for such quality. However, the provision of high-quality ECE services is still a major challenge facing Indonesia. The initial step for the development of a QA system has already been taken in the form of the regulatory framework from the constitution itself to government, presidential and ministerial regulations and the ministry&rsquo;s strategic plan as well as the establishing of national standards for ECE services. The establishment of a Directorate General of Early Childhood Education and Community Education (DGPAUD DIKMAS) in the restructuring of MoEC is an example of such move. What is critical at this stage is to ensure the effective implementation of these regulations, particularly at the decentralised district and community levels, as well as to establish the processes to assure the quality aligned to such standards is being achieved.</p>

	<p>Various institutions at central level have not coordinated well with institutions at the provincial and district levels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Lack of coordination and communication among the central level bodies has led to a situation in which actors in field level do not yet understand the policies relating to the quality assurance system and are unsure of the division of roles between the various institutions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The majority of providers have not yet been able to meet the national standards for ECE quality.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenges to effective implementation of quality assurance in future will be even greater in light of the reorganization of MoEC (based on <a href=""http://repo.unand.ac.id/2802/1/permendikbud_tahun2015_nomor011.pdf"" target=""_blank"">MoEC Regulation 11/2015</a>). The Center for Media Education Development (PPMP) has been disbanded and the various functions relating to education quality assurance have been divided between multiple program directorates. This means that the need for active collaboration among all actors involved in the system is even greater if the weaknesses of the previous system are to be avoided.</p>

","Penjaminan Mutu Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini","<p>Quality Assurance (QA), atau penjaminan mutu, mengacu pada proses pemeriksaan yang sistematis dan efektif untuk melihat apakah layanan yang sedang dikembangkan memenuhi persyaratan atau standar yang ditentukan. Untuk meningkatkan kapasitas anak-anak (sejak lahir sampai usia 6 tahun) untuk mengembangkan dan belajar, layanan pendidikan anak usia dini harus berkualitas tinggi dan penyedia layanan harus bertanggung jawab atas kualitas tersebut. Namun, penyediaan layanan ECE berkualitas tinggi masih menjadi tantangan utama yang dihadapi Indonesia. Langkah awal pengembangan sistem QA telah diambil dalam bentuk kerangka peraturan dari konstitusi itu sendiri untuk peraturan pemerintah, presiden dan menteri dan rencana strategis kementerian serta penetapan standar nasional untuk layanan ECE. Pembentukan Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini dan Pendidikan Masyarakat (DGPAUD DIKMAS) dalam restrukturisasi MoEC adalah contoh langkah tersebut. Yang penting pada tahap ini adalah memastikan penerapan peraturan ini secara efektif, terutama di tingkat kabupaten dan masyarakat yang terdesentralisasi, dan juga untuk menetapkan proses untuk memastikan kualitas yang sesuai dengan standar tersebut tercapai.</p>

	<li>Berbagai lembaga di tingkat pusat belum berkoordinasi dengan baik dengan institusi di tingkat provinsi dan kabupaten.</li>
	<li>Kurangnya koordinasi dan komunikasi di antara badan-badan tingkat pusat telah menyebabkan situasi di mana aktor di tingkat lapangan belum memahami kebijakan yang berkaitan dengan sistem penjaminan mutu dan tidak yakin akan pembagian peran antara berbagai institusi.</li>
	<li>Mayoritas penyedia layanan belum dapat memenuhi standar nasional untuk kualitas ECE.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tantangan penerapan jaminan kualitas yang efektif di masa depan akan semakin besar mengingat reorganisasi MoEC (berdasarkan Peraturan Menteri Kehakiman RI 11/2015). Pusat Pengembangan Pendidikan Media (PPMP) telah dibubarkan dan berbagai fungsi yang berkaitan dengan jaminan kualitas pendidikan telah terbagi antara beberapa program direktorat. Ini berarti bahwa kebutuhan akan kolaborasi aktif di antara semua aktor yang terlibat dalam sistem lebih besar lagi jika kelemahan sistem sebelumnya harus dihindari.</p>

Indonesia&rsquo;s Ministerial Regulation 44/2002 mandated school-based management, making the principal the key decision maker. These include finance and budgeting, staff management, school planning, and curriculum development roles, thus requiring principals to have upgraded skills. Principals Preparation Program (PPP) is conducted to ensure those eligible to become principals are ready for the job. The program has an explicit purpose: coherence between content and goals, the right balance of theory and practice, appropriate admissions criteria, and a focus on continuing assessment.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Two aspects of PPP considered effective are Nomor Unik Kepala Sekolah (NUKS), an official principal registration number, and PPP mentoring program. Teachers who successfully complete professional learning will receive a NUKS, which indicates a teacher as eligible to become school principal. NUKS is considered prestigious and clear in terms of standards. Mentoring program, on the other hand, is conducted in part by Master Trainers, who are trained, accredited and employed by LPPKS (principal development institution).</p>

	<p>In terms of PPP, unfortunately, the degree of political and bureaucratic involvement in identifying applicants into PPP and in the appointment of school principals was a problem. &nbsp;However, based on data from LPPKS, only between 1.2% and 2.1% of all principals had a NUKS in 2014/2015.</p>

"40","1","School Supervisors","<p dir=""ltr"">School supervisors play an essential role in an education system. &nbsp;They are expected to act as both education managers and &lsquo;leaders of learning&rsquo;. &nbsp;They need to ensure application of education standards such as 1) inspecting and evaluating, and 2) advising, assisting, and supporting teachers and school leadership. The globally continuing debate is whether school supervisors should focus one or the other.</p>

<p>Ministerial Regulation of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform no. 21 of 2010 describes the supervisor as a &ldquo;civil servant...responsible&hellip;to conduct academic and managerial supervision on education units&rdquo;. School supervisors are required to meet Minimum Service Standards (MSS), and the competencies required of school supervisors are further defined in Ministerial Decree 12/2007. Ministerial Regulation No. 21 of 2010 also outlines the main tasks of supervisors, which include monitoring the implementation of Indonesia&rsquo;s eight National Education Standards, among others.</p>

<p>The key challenge suggested by many publications on school supervision in Indonesia is the recruitment process.&nbsp;Some suggested that supervisors should have experience in school leadership positions.</p>

<p>A 2013 ACDP survey of supervisors and principals validated that supervisors were deficient in competencies needed to improve learning. The survey rated supervisors (through self-ratings and ratings by teachers and principals) on, among others, personality/character, social (taking an active role in the supervisors&rsquo; association, etc.), and managerial as well as academic supervision.</p>

<p>Points of challenges identified through the survey:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Supervisors generally were rated high in &ldquo;Social&rdquo; and &ldquo;Personality&rdquo; dimensions of competencies and low in &ldquo;Research&rdquo; and &ldquo;Academic Supervision&rdquo;, with considerable variation between regions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Field studies showed that a significant proportion of supervisors had little understanding about the content of National Education Standards or how such standards could be used to benefit schools and student learning.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Though the survey suggests that participation in INPRES training did have a positive impact on supervisor competency, more research needs to be done to determine whether training leads to improvement in education quality and student learning outcome.</p>
	</li>
	<li>The survey also revealed that supervisors undertook minimal continued professional development (CPD) training in the three years prior to the study.</li>

"41","1","Teacher Management","<p>Strategic plan for the improvement of Indonesia&rsquo;s education system includes the issues of teacher management and development. Teachers as the gatekeepers of classrooms are the epicenter of students&rsquo; learning process. Absence of a proper management system may lead not only to a worsened learning process, but also costs. Improvement of teacher management cannot come solely from teachers. Indeed, a majority of possible improvements require the right decisions and implementations by school administrators and policymakers.</p>

<div class=""collapsible-item-body panel-body"">
<p>Teacher management issues can be grouped into four major areas: supply, cost, distribution&nbsp;and cost.</p>

<p><u>Supply</u></p>

<p>Oversupply: Teachers were <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=16"" target=""_blank"">distributed unevenly</a> throughout the system, which causes some schools to have shortage others surplus.</p>

<p>Supply of New Teachers and Planning of Teacher Supply:&nbsp;Currently, there is no system to monitor teachers&rsquo; qualities and the outcome of students&rsquo; learning.</p>

<p><u>Quality</u></p>

<p>Single Subject Teachers and 24-hour Rule: &nbsp;Teachers are mandated by national policy to provide a minimum of 24-hour face-to-face teaching per week, which causes teacher absenteeism to increase, especially those who teach in multiple schools.</p>

<p>Teacher Utilization: The productivity of teachers is affected by the oversupply and inequitable distribution of teachers since they both impact the number of classes taught, hours worked in the school week and efficient timetabling. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=20"" target=""_blank"">Teacher Absenteeism</a>: About one of ten teachers are found to be absent from schools when they are scheduled to teach, with a number of reasons including attending official teaching-related meeting.</p>

<p><a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=7"" target=""_blank"">School Leadership</a>: School <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=17"" target=""_blank"">principals</a> have tended to focus on the administrative aspects of the teacher appraisal system practiced in schools. Many principals and supervisors feel uncomfortable and unqualified to make professional judgment about teachers.</p>

<p><u>Distribution</u></p>

<p>Inefficiencies Relating to student-to-teacher ratio (STR): &nbsp;Indonesia has one of the lowest STR due to the increased recruitment of poor quality teachers.</p>

<p>Nine-Teacher Formula: <a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=1"" target=""_blank"">Primary schools</a> are staffed according to a formula that every school should have a minimum of nine teachers--which cause an inefficiency in staffing.</p>

<p><a href=""/topic.php?lang=1&amp;link=topic&amp;id=27"" target=""_blank""><u>Cost</u></a></p>

<p>There is a significant increase in the cost of employing teachers and the overall education budget, which was the result of ongoing teacher certification program guaranteeing certified teachers a professional allowance equivalent to their basic pay. &nbsp;Budget data on teacher salaries is often not available at district level. Under current procedures, districts hire teachers but the central government pays for their salaries, which leads to a perverse incentive for districts to increase the proportion and number of civil servants teachers.</p>

<div class=""collapsible-item-body panel-body"">
<p><u>Supply</u></p>

<p>Oversupply:&nbsp;Some of the possible policy options that can fix this issue are by not replacing teachers in schools that are already overstaffed, allocating future teachers based on Teacher-Students ratio, eliminating small schools, expanding incentives for teaching in rural and remote areas.</p>

<p>Supply of New Teachers and Planning of Teachers Supply:&nbsp;To fix this issue, teacher supply needs to be managed and controlled based on the efficiency and accuracy of teacher data. It also needs to be carefully disaggregated based on the academic levels (SD,SMP,SMA/SMK) &nbsp;and specific subjects.</p>

<p><u>Quality</u></p>

<p>Single Subject Teachers and 24-Hour Rule: The 24-hour rule needs to be changed, and teachers should be qualified to teach two subjects.</p>

<p>Teacher Utilization: School principals and supervisors need to improve teacher management. &nbsp;There also needs to be a quality assurance training for principals and supervisors to better utilize teachers&rsquo; time outside class when they are at schools.</p>

<p>Teacher Absenteeism: &nbsp;Some possible policy options include strengthening supervision in teaching and learning by supervisor, monitoring teachers&rsquo; attendance, ensuring plenty of suitable replacement teachers, and guaranteeing teachers are not expected at official meetings during school hours.</p>

<p>School Leadership: Some ways to fix this include ensuring principals and supervisors are well-trained, improving the system of independent school and teacher supervision, extending teacher appraisal system, and reviewing the current 5-steps teacher career structure.</p>

<p><u>Distribution</u></p>

<p>Inefficiencies Relating to STR: A new STR needs to be established. There is also a need to allocate teachers according STR rather than student groups.</p>

<p>Nine-Teacher Formula: This formula needs to be eliminated. Teachers are to develop diverse learning needs, train school principals to handle staffs more efficiently and effectively in small schools, and merge small schools in both urban and rural areas.</p>

<p><u>Cost</u></p>

<p>A review that measures the impact of complicated funding system for the salaries of the various types of teachers (PNS, contract and honorary) is required.</p>

","Manajemen Guru","<p>Rencana strategis untuk perbaikan sistem pendidikan Indonesia meliputi permasalahan manajemen dan pengembangan guru. Guru sebagai penjaga ruang kelas merupakan pusat dari proses pembelajaran siswa. Tidak adanya sistem manajemen yang tepat dapat menyebabkan tidak hanya proses belajar&nbsp; yang memburuk, tetapi juga biaya. Peningkatan manajemen guru tidak bisa datang hanya dari guru. Oleh karena itu, mayoritas perbaikan membutuhkan keputusan yang tepat dan pelaksanaannya oleh para pelaksana sekolah dan pembuat kebijakan.</p>

<div class=""collapsible-item-body panel-body"">
<p>Permasalahan seputar manajemen guru di Indonesia dapat dikelompokkan ke dalam empat bidang utama: ketersediaan, kualitas, penyebaran, dan biaya.</p>

<p><strong>Ketersediaan</strong></p>

<p><u>Kelebihan Ketersediaan</u>: Para guru tidak tersebar merata di seluruh sistem, yang menyebabkan beberapa sekolah kekurangan guru sementara yang lain kelebihan.</p>

<p><u>Ketersediaan Guru Baru dan Perencanaan Ketersediaan Guru:</u>&nbsp; Saat ini, tidak ada sistem yang memonitor kualitas guru dan hasil belajar siswa .</p>

<p><strong>Kualitas</strong></p>

<p><u>Guru Mata Pelajaran tunggal dan Aturan 24 jam mengajar</u>: Guru diamanatkan dalam kebijakan nasional untuk minimal memenuhi 24 jam mengajar di kelas per minggu, yang menyebabkan meningkatnya &nbsp;ketidakhadiran guru, terutama karena mengajar di beberapa sekolah.</p>

<p><u>Pemanfaatan Guru:</u> produktivitas guru dipengaruhi oleh penyebaran kelebihan atau ketidakmerataan guru sebagai akibat dari jumlah kelas yang diajarkan, jam kerja sekolah per minggu dan penjadwalan yang efisien.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Ketidakhadiran Guru:</u> Sekitar satu dari sepuluh guru ditemukan absen dari sekolah ketika mereka dijadwalkan untuk mengajar, dengan sejumlah alasan termasuk menghadiri rapat resmi terkait pengajaran. &nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Kepemimpinan Sekolah:</u>kepala sekolah cenderung fokus pada aspek administratif &nbsp;sistem penilaian guru yang dipraktekkan di sekolah-sekolah. Banyak kepala sekolah dan pengawas merasa tidak nyaman dan tidak memenuhi syarat untuk membuat penilaian profesional tentang guru.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Penyebaran</strong></p>

<p><u>Inefisiensi Terkait dengan STR:</u>&nbsp; Indonesia merupakan salah satu yang memiliki &nbsp;rasio siswa-guru terendah (STR) karena meningkatnya perekrutan guru berkualitas buruk.</p>

<p><u>Formula Sembilan Guru:</u> sekolah dasar menerapkan formula wajib sekolah yang mengharuskan memiliki minimal sembilan guru - menyebabkan inefisiensi dalam kepegawaian.</p>

<p><strong>Biaya</strong></p>

<p>Ada peningkatan signifikan pada biaya mempekerjakan guru dan anggaran pendidikan secara keseluruhan, sebagai akibat dari program sertifikasi guru yang menjamin guru tersertifikasi menerima tunjangan profesi setara dengan gaji pokok mereka. Data anggaran untuk gaji guru seringkali &nbsp;tidak memadai di tingkat kabupaten. Dengan prosedur sekarang ini, kabupaten mempekerjakan guru tapi pemerintah pusat yang membayar gaji mereka, yang mengakibatkan insentif yang buruk bagi daerah untuk meningkatkan proporsi dan jumlah guru PNS.</p>

<div class=""collapsible-item-body panel-body"">
<p><strong>Ketersediaan</strong></p>

<p><u>Kelebihan Ketersediaan:</u>&nbsp; Beberapa kemungkinan pilihan kebijakan untuk mengatasi masalah ini adalah dengan tidak mengganti guru di sekolah yang sudah kelebihan pegawai, mengalokasikan guru baru berdasarkan rasio Siswa - Guru, menghilangkan sekolah kecil, menambah insentif untuk mengajar di daerah pedesaan dan terpencil.</p>

<p><u>Ketersediaan Guru Baru dan Perencanaan Ketersediaan Guru:</u>Untuk mengatasi masalah ini, ketersediaan guru perlu dikelola dan dikontrol berdasarkan efisiensi dan akurasi data guru. Disamping itu &nbsp;juga perlu memisahkannya berdasarkan tingkat akademik (SD, SMP, SMA / SMK) dan mata pelajaran tertentu.</p>

<p><strong>Kualitas</strong></p>

<p><u>Guru Mata Pelajaran tunggal dan Peraturan 24-Jam Mengajar: </u>Aturan 24 jam perlu diubah, dan guru harus memiliki kemampuan untuk mengajar dua mata pelajaran.</p>

<p><u>Pemanfaatan Guru:</u>Kepala sekolah dan pengawas perlu memperbaiki manajemen guru. Mereka &nbsp;juga perlu mengikuti pelatihan jaminan mutu untuk agar mampu untuk lebih memanfaatkan waktu guru di luar kelas ketika mereka berada di sekolah.</p>

<p><u>Ketidakhadiran Guru:</u>&nbsp; Beberapa pilihan kebijakan daintaranya ialah memperkuat pengawasan dalam proses belajar mengajar oleh pengawas, monitoring kehadiran guru, menyediakan sejumlah guru pengganti yang cocok, dan menjamin guru supaya tidak mengikuti rapat resmi selama jam sekolah.</p>

<p><u>Kepemimpinan Sekolah:</u> Beberapa cara untuk memperbaikinya ialah memastikan kepala sekolah dan pengawas yang terlatih, memperbaiki sistem sekolah independen dan pengawasan guru, memperbaiki sistem penilaian guru, dan meninjau struktur 5-tahapan karir guru saat ini.</p>

<p><strong>Penyebaran</strong></p>

<p><u>Inefisiensi terkait &nbsp;dengan STR:</u> STR baru perlu ditentukan. Ada juga kebutuhan untuk mengalokasikan guru sesuai STR daripada rombongan belajar siswa.</p>

<p><u>Formula Sembilan Guru:</u>Formula ini perlu dihilangkan. Guru harus mengembangkan kebutuhan belajar yang beragam, melatih kepala sekolah untuk menangani staf lebih efisien dan efektif di sekolah-sekolah kecil, dan menggabungkan sekolah kecil di daerah perkotaan dan pedesaan.</p>

<p><strong>Biaya</strong></p>

<p>Tinjauan yang mengukur dampak dari sistem pendanaan yang rumit untuk gaji berbagai jenis guru (PNS, kontrak dan honorer) diperlukan.</p>

<div class=""collapsible-item-body panel-body"">
<p>A recent study found that there are major shortfalls against minimum service standards, with no schools meeting them. The study found that schools in almost all areas had difficulties meeting the standards related to providing some of the key facilities and teaching resources. Books and, particularly, facilities and equipment for science teaching at both elementary and junior secondary level are too often in short supply. In most cases, the shortage of books is significant. For example, just 10% of junior secondary schools were found to have adequate science labs with furniture.</p>

<p>Critical shortfalls have been found not only in school resources and infrastructure, which have been of primary concern to administrators, but also in important educational processes especially in areas such as supervision, lesson planning, and student assessment. For instance, only 23% of primary schools and just 20% of junior secondary schools were found to receive monthly visits from supervisors. Performance against MSS tends to also be lower in parts of Eastern Indonesia as opposed, for example, to Java.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that the cost of eliminating current shortfalls to ensure that all schools reach minimum service levels is significant. For example, the cost of eliminating shortfalls in capital budget items, such as buildings and classrooms, alone has been estimated to amount to at least Rp. 20.232 trillion.</p>

<p>Many of the largest shortfalls are found areas related to quality, and more attention should be paid to the quality aspect of the learning-teaching process. There is a large opportunity to eliminate these shortfalls - especially those relating to teaching, leadership and supervision practices &ndash; which would not require significant additional expenditure. Eliminating shortfalls in these low-cost areas, for example in the teaching process and in reporting to parents, can make a huge difference in the quality of education provided in underperforming schools.</p>

<p>Based on a study conducted by MoEC, only 19.77% of Junior Secondary School Principals conduct regular classroom supervision and provide feedback to teachers at least 2 times each semester. Other findings suggested that only 50.21% of primary schools deliver 34 weeks of teaching per-year.</p>

<p>Availability of teaching facilities, which support quality of learning, is also low, with only 4.53% of junior secondary schools owning science labs with adequate desks and chairs to accommodate 36 students and having a minimum of 1 set of equipment for science practice, to demonstrate learning and allow students to gain direct experience. Only 37.12% of junior secondary schools provide textbooks of appropriate quality and relevance as regulated by the State, with a proportion of one set for each student. This is despite the many national/international programs that have been implemented to support book supply.</p>

<p>Parents have the right to demand from schools and from local and national government that their children&rsquo;s education conforms to at least minimum standards for quality.</p>

<p>A recent OECD review of the Indonesian education system found that currently parents and the community do not pay attention to the quality of schooling; instead, they mainly want for their children to gain an education certificate. As long as children pass and graduate, parents are happy. Engaging parents in school decision making and activities at school can increases parents&rsquo; demand for quality education.</p>

<p>Neither parents nor school committees are currently actively involved in school decision making and activities. Principals tend to see school committees as no more than an intermediary to inform parents of school decisions and, in turn, the attitude of committee members is one of no interference and deference to school staff.</p>

","Standar Pelayanan Minimal Pendidikan Dasar","<p>Program wajib belajar Indonesia&nbsp; 12 tahun berupaya untuk mengulang kesuksesan Program Wajib Belajar 9 tahun didalam mencapai pendidikan dasar universal. Namun, layanan pendidikan dasar yang ada baik di daerah perkotaan dan pedesaan memiliki kualitas yang jelek dan kurang relevan dengan kondisi sosial dan ekonomi di daerah. Kualitas layanan pendidikan ini mempengaruhi keputusan siswa dan orang tua untuk tetap tinggal atau berhenti sekolah. Pendidikan dasar yang berkualitas buruk akan menurunkan jumlah siswa yang melanjutkan ke tingkat pendidikan menengah sehingga tujuan pendidikan universal 12 tahun akan sulit dipenuhi.</p>

<p>Untuk mengatasi masalah kualitas ini, pemerintah telah menerapkan beberapa program dalam beberapa tahun terakhir. Standar Pelayanan Minimum (SPM) bertujuan untuk memastikan bahwa setiap sekolah dan <em>madrasah </em>memenuhi setidaknya kondisi minimum yang dibutuhkan pengajaran dan pembelajaran yang berkualitas.</p>

<p><u>Standar Pelayanan Minimum Pendidikan Dasar</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>SPM menjadi dasar untuk layanan pendidikan yang harus diselenggarakan oleh semua kabupaten dan sekolah termasuk madrasah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>SPM berisi 27 standar individu termasuk penyediaan ruang kelas yang memadai, guru yang kompeten dan sumber daya yang memadai seperti buku pelajaran (daftar lengkap ada dalam Lampiran).</li>
	<li>Standar dibagi menjadi dua bidang: standar yang harus dipenuhi oleh pemerintah kabupaten dan standar yang harus dipenuhi oleh sekolah (oleh manajemen sekolah dan guru).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>SPM telah dikembangkan untuk pendidikan dasar, yang meliputi sekolah SD dan SMP, dan diperkenalkan pada tahun 2010 melalui Peraturan Menteri Nomor 15 tentang Standar Pelayanan Minimal. Standar ini dioptimalkan melalui Peraturan Menteri No. 23/2013 sebagai penyempurnaan dari peraturan sebelumnya.</li>
	<li>SPM saat ini sedang dikembangkan untuk pendidikan anak usia dini dan pendidikan menengah atas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Standar pelayanan minimum adalah bagian dari sistem jaminan mutu nasional, yang juga termasuk sistem akreditasi sekolah nasional dan Standar Nasional Pendidikan (SNP).</li>
	<li>SPM dianggap sebagai &#39;jembatan&#39; dalam mengimplementasikan SPM aspiratif.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p>Penelitian terkini menemukan bahwa ada banyak kekurangan dalam standar pelayanan minimum, dimana tidak ada satu pun sekolah yang dapat memenuhinya. Penelitian ini &nbsp;menunjukan bahwa sekolah di hampir semua daerah mengalami kesulitan untuk memenuhi standar terkait penyediaan beberapa fasilitas penting dan sumber daya pengajaran. Buku dan, khususnya, fasilitas dan peralatan untuk mengajar sains baik di tingkat SD dan SMP sering tidak tersedia. Dalam bebrapa kasus, buku juga kurang. Sebagai contoh, hanya 10% dari sekolah menengah pertama yang &nbsp;memiliki laboratorium sains yang memadai dengan furniturnya.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kekurangan ini ditemukan tidak hanya pada sumber daya dan infrastruktur sekolah, yang mendapatkan perhatian utama para pengelola, tetapi juga dalam proses pendidikan khususnya pada bidang-bidang seperti pengawasan, perencanaan pelajaran, dan penilaian siswa. Sebagai contoh, hanya 23% sekolah dasar dan hanya 20% sekolah menengah pertama yang mendapatkan kunjungan bulanan dari supervisor. Upaya pemenuhan SPM cenderung lebih rendah di wilayah Indonesia Timur dibanding dengan Jawa misalnya.</p>

<p>Diperkirakan bahwa biaya untuk mengatasi kekurangan saat ini agar semua sekolah dapat memenuhi standar pelayanan minimum adalah signifikan. Sebagai contoh, biaya mengatasi kekurangan dalam item anggaran modal, seperti bangunan dan ruang kelas, diperkirakan berjumlah minimal Rp. 20,232 triliun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Banyak sekali kekurangan ditemukan terkait dengan kualitas, dan lebih banyak perhatian harus diberikan pada aspek kualitas proses belajar-mengajar. Ada kesempatan besar untuk menghilangkan kekurangan ini - terutama yang berkaitan dengan praktek pengajaran, kepemimpinan dan pengawasan - yang tidak membutuhkan pengeluaran tambahan yang signifikan. Mengatasi &nbsp;kekurangan pada bidang-bidang berbiaya lebih kecil, misalnya dalam proses pengajaran dan pelaporan kepada orang tua, dapat membuat perbedaan besar dalam kualitas pendidikan yang diberikan di sekolah-sekolah berkinerja buruk.</p>

<p>Berdasarkan penelitian yang dilakukan oleh Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, hanya 19,77% dari Kepala SMP melakukan pengawasan kelas secara reguler dan memberikan umpan balik kepada guru minimal 2 kali setiap semester. Temuan lain menunjukkan bahwa hanya 50,21% sekolah dasar memberikan 34 minggu pengajaran per tahun.</p>

<p>Ketersediaan fasilitas pengajaran, yang mendukung kualitas pembelajaran, juga rendah, dimana hanya 4,53% sekolah menengah pertama yang memiliki laboratorium sains dengan meja dan kursi yang memadai untuk mengakomodasi 36 siswa dan memiliki minimal 1 set peralatan untuk praktek sains dalam mendemonstrasikan pembelajaran serta memberikan pengalaman langsung pada siswa. Hanya 37.12% sekolah menengah pertama memiliki buku pelajaran berkualitas dan relevan sebagaimana diatur oleh Negara, dengan proporsi satu set untuk setiap siswa. Hal ini terjadi walaupun banyak program nasional / internasional yang telah dilaksanakan untuk mendukung ketersediaan buku.</p>

<p>Baik orang tua maupun komite sekolah saat ini tidak aktif terlibat dalam pengambilan keputusan dan kegiatan sekolah.</p>

<p>Baik orang tua maupun komite sekolah saat ini tidak aktif terlibat dalam pengambilan keputusan dan kegiatan sekolah.

"43","1","Indonesia Qualifications Framework (IQF)","<p dir=""ltr"">Many countries seek to establish qualifications frameworks in order to increase the global mobility of workers. Qualifications framework sets standards and criteria for a nation&rsquo;s agreed qualifications and allow skills and qualifications gained elsewhere to be acknowledged. The Indonesian Qualifications Framework (IQF) was established to respond to national needs and regional and global trends of economic integration. The three main players in developing Indonesia&rsquo;s qualification framework are the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC), Ministry of Manpower (MoM) and the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education (MoRTHE).</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The current stage of implementation of IQF varies among different sectors in Indonesia. Recent developments include:</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://asean.org/asean-economic-community/"" target=""_blank"">ASEAN Economic Community (AEC)</a>. The establishment of AEC in 2015 was an achievement in merging ten Southeast Asian nations into a single market for goods, services, capital, and labor in Southeast Asia, where areas of cooperation include human resources development, capacity building and recognition of professional qualifications. Member countries also endorsed the <a href=""http://asean.org/asean-economic-community/sectoral-bodies-under-the-purview-of-aem/services/asean-qualifications-reference-framework/"" target=""_blank"">ASEAN Qualifications Reference Framework (AQRF)</a>.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Indonesia&rsquo;s qualification framework will also open new opportunities previously impossible, such as RPL. RPL is a process conducted by formal institutions to assess skills and knowledge acquired outside these institutions. In the education sector, RPL allows access to formal education while advocating the upgrading of skills and knowledge. It also acknowledges quality equivalences between education institutions. In the employment sector, RPL is used to equate job qualifications and competencies between training providers and workplaces.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Performing RPL aims to expand education access for people in the labor market so they can achieve higher qualifications (i.e. by re-entering formal higher education institutions) and to recruit professionals as lecturers.</p>

<p>Professional Certifications. The National Agency for Professional Certification (BNSP), under the MoM, is responsible for carrying out certification through the provision of licenses to professional certification bodies (PCB or LSP). Many higher education institutions are also licensed to certify their graduates on behalf of professional associations.</p>

	<p>Indonesia&rsquo;s manpower challenge includes a mismatch between education outcomes and workforce needs. &nbsp;Employers express dissatisfaction with the quality of graduates they recruit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Employers have also reported disparities in the quality and types of skills graduates attain at university. University graduates with similar qualifications often have acquired considerably different sets of skills and knowledge, and there are large variations in standards. This makes it difficult for employers to trust qualifications that students have. Many employers resort to informal sources of recruitment rather than official sources due to the latter&rsquo;s lack of reliability.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Coordination between relevant ministries is weak, which is increasing cost, causing overlapping regulations, and creating inefficient bureaucracy.</p>

	<p>Relevant stakeholders, including employers, are often not included in developing the learning outcomes for qualifications.</p>

","Kerangka Kualifikasi Nasional Indonesia","<p>Banyak negara berusaha untuk membangun kerangka kualifikasi untuk meningkatkan mobilitas global pekerja. Kerangka kualifikasi menetapkan standar dan kriteria kualifikasi bangsa yang disetujui dan memungkinkan keterampilan dan kualifikasi yang diperoleh di tempat lain untuk diakui. Kerangka Kualifikasi Nasional Indonesia (KKNI) didirikan untuk merespon kebutuhan nasional dan tren regional serta integrasi ekonomi global. Tiga pemeran utama dalam pengembangan kerangka kualifikasi nasional Indonesia adalah Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan (Kemendikbud), Kementerian Tenaga Kerja (Kemenaker) dan Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi (Kemenristekdikti).</p>

<p>Tahapan pelaksanaan KKNI beragam&nbsp; antara berbagai sektor di Indonesia. Pengembangan sekarang meliputi:</p>

<p><u>Masyarakat Ekonomi ASEAN (MEA)</u>. Pembentukan MEA pada tahun 2015 merupakan sebuah prestasi dalam penggabungan sepuluh negara Asia Tenggara menjadi pasar tunggal untuk barang, jasa, modal, dan tenaga kerja di Asia Tenggara, di mana bidang kerjasamanya meliputi pengembangan sumber daya manusia, peningkatan kapasitas dan pengakuan kualifikasi profesional. Negara-negara anggota juga mendukung Kerangka Acuan Kualifikasi ASEAN (AQRF).</p>

<p><u>Pengakuan Pembelajaran Sebelumnya (RPL)</u>. Kerangka kualifikasi nasional&nbsp; Indonesia membuka peluang baru yang sebelumnya tidak mungkin, seperti RPL. RPL adalah suatu proses yang dilakukan oleh lembaga formal untuk menilai keterampilan dan pengetahuan yang diperoleh di luar lembaga tersebut. Di sektor pendidikan, RPL memungkinkan akses ke pendidikan formal dan mendapatkan advokasi peningkatan keterampilan dan pengetahuan. RPL &nbsp;juga mengakui kesetaraan kualitas antara lembaga pendidikan. Di sektor ketenagakerjaan, RPL digunakan untuk menyamakan kualifikasi pekerjaan dan kompetensi antara penyedia pelatihan dan tempat kerja.</p>

<p>Pelaksanaan &nbsp;RPL bertujuan untuk memperluas akses pendidikan bagi orang-orang di pasar tenaga kerja sehingga mereka dapat mencapai kualifikasi yang lebih tinggi (yaitu dengan memasuki kembali lembaga pendidikan tinggi formal) dan untuk merekrut profesional sebagai dosen.</p>

<p><u><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">Sertifikasi Profesi</span></span></u><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">. Badan Nasional Sertifikasi Profesi (BNSP), di bawah Kemenaker, bertanggung jawab untuk melaksanakan sertifikasi melalui pemberian lisensi untuk lembaga sertifikasi profesi (LSP).

	<li>Pengusaha juga telah menemukan kesenjangan dalam kualitas dan jenis keterampilan lulusan yang diperoleh universitas. Lulusan universitas dengan kualifikasi yang sama seringkali &nbsp;memiliki keterampilan dan pengetahuan yang berbeda, dan ada perbedaan standar yang besar.
